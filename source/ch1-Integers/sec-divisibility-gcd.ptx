    		<title>Divisibility and the Division Algorithm</title>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we begin to explore some of the arithmetic and algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m>. We focus specifically on the divisibility and factorization properties of the integers, as these are the main focus of the text as a whole.
      One of the primary goals of this section is to formalize definitions that you are likely already familiar with and of which you have an intuitive understanding.
      At first,
      this might seem to unnecessarily complicate matters. 
      However, it will become clear as we move forward that formal mathematical language and notation are necessary to extend these properties to a more abstract setting.
      We begin with a familiar notion.

        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \Z</m>.
          We say that <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
          <m>b</m>, and write <m>a\mid b</m>,
          if there is an integer <m>c</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
          In this case, say that <m>a</m> and <m>c</m> are <term>factors</term> of <m>b</m>.
          If no such <m>c\in \Z</m> exists, we write <m>a\nmid b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note that the symbol <m>|</m> is a <em>verb</em>;
      it is therefore correct to say,
      e.g., <m>2|4</m>, as 2 <em>does</em> divide 4.
      However, it is an abuse of notation to say that <m>2\mid 4 = 2</m>.
      Instead, we likely mean <m>4\div 2 = 2</m> or <m>\frac{4}{2} = 2</m>
      (though we will not deal in fractions just yet).

    <theorem>

        <p>
          Let <m>a,b,c\in\Z</m>.
          If <m>a\mid b</m> and <m>a\mid c</m>, then <m>a\mid (b+c)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Our hypothesis means that there exist integers <m>k_1</m> and <m>k_2</m> such that
        <m>b = a k_1</m> and <m>c = a k_2</m>.
        Then <m>b+c = a k_1 + a k_2 = a(k_1 + k_2)</m>.
        Let <m>k' = k_1 + k_2</m>, and observe that <m>k'</m> is an integer;
        then <m>b+c = a k'</m>, so <m>a\mid (b+c)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-divideproduct">

        We consider two cases.

    <p>
      As we saw above,
      not all pairs of integers <m>a,b</m> satisfy <m>a\mid b</m> or <m>b\mid a</m>.
      However,
      <url href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/NBT/B/6/">our experience in elementary mathematics does apply:
      there is often something left over (a remainder)</url>.
      The following theorem formalizes this idea for <m>a,b\in \N</m>.
    </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm_divisionAlgorithm">
      <title>The Division Algorithm for <m>\N</m></title>
      <idx>Division Algorithm (<m>\N</m>)</idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b\in \N</m>.
          Then there exist unique integers <m>q,r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,
          where <m>0 \le r \lt b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
      	<p>
      		There are two parts to this theorem. First, you must establish that <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist. This is best done via <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" />. If you're stuck on that, check the second hint.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Once you have established that <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist, show that they are unique but assuming <m>a = bq+r</m> and <m>a = bq' + r'</m>, where <m>r,r'</m> both satisfy the conditions of the theorem. Argue that <m>q = q'</m> and <m>r = r'</m>.
      	</p>
      </hint>
      <hint>
      	<p>
      		Let <m>S = \{a-bs\mid s\in \N_0, a-bs\ge 0\}</m>.
      	</p>

      </hint>

      <proof>
      <p>
        First, assume that <m>a \lt b</m>.
        Then <m>q = 0</m> and <m>r = a</m> are sufficient.
        If <m>a = b</m>, then <m>q = 1</m> and <m>r = 0</m> will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assume that <m>a > b</m>.
        Then the set <m>S = \{s\in\N\mi0d a-bs \ge 0\}</m> is nonempty, as <m>a-b\in S</m>.
        By <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" />, <m>S</m> has a least element, which we will call <m>r</m>.
        Let <m>q\in \N_0</m> be such that <m>r = a-bq</m>; then <m>a = bq + r</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the proof,
        it is enough to show that this choice of <m>r</m> satisfies <m>0\le r \le b-1</m>.
        Observe that <m>r\in S</m>, so <m>r\ge 0</m>.
        If <m>r \ge b</m>, then <m>a - b(q+1) = a-bq -b = r -b \ge 0</m>.
        Since <m>q+1 > q</m>,
        this is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>q</m> was the largest element of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>r \lt b</m>, i.e., <m>r \le b-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>q,q',r,r'</m> be such that <m>a = bq+r</m> and <m>a=bq'+r'</m>.
        We see that <m>bq+r = bq' + r'</m>,
        so <m>b(q-q') = r'-r</m>, so <m>b|r'-r</m>.
        If <m>r'-r = 0</m>, we are done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, <m>r'-r</m> is a nonzero multiple of <m>n</m>.
        If <m>r' \ge r</m>,
        then <m>0\le b(q-q') = r' - r \le b-1 - r</m>, a contradiction.
        Similarly, if <m>r' \le r</m>,
        write <m>b(q'-q) = r-r' \ge 0</m>,
        and a symmetric argument leads to a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>r' = r</m>, so <m>b(q-q') = 0</m>,
        and since <m>b > 0</m>, <m>q - q'= 0</m>, i.e., <m>q = q'</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

        Suppose <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>,

        say <m>e q_1 = b</m> and <m>e q_2 = r</m>.
        Then <m>a = n b + r = n (e q_1) + (e q_2)= e (n q_1 + q_2)</m>,
        so <m>e|a</m>,
        contradicting the assumption that <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>.
        Thus <m>e = \gcd(b,r) \le d</m>, hence <m>e = d</m>.

      </hint>

      <proof>
      
      	<p>
      		Consider the set <m>S = \{as+bt\mid s,t\in\Z, \ as+bt \gt 0\}</m>.
      		We first show that <m>S\ne \emptyset</m>.
      	</p>
		<p>      		
      		Suppose without loss of generality that <m>a\ne 0</m>, and consider <m>a \gt 0</m>; then <m>s=1, t = 0</m> is sufficient to guarantee <m>as+bt\in S</m>.
      		If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>s = -1, t= 0</m> is sufficient.
      		Regardless, <m>S\ne \emptyset</m>, and by the Well-Ordering Principle, <m>S</m> has a least element, <m>d = ax+by</m>.
      		We claim <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>.
      	</p>
		
		<p>
			We first show that <m>d|a</m>
			Use the division algorithm to write <m>a = dq + r</m>, where <m>r \lt d</m>.
			We find <m>r = a - dq = a - (ax+by)q = a(1-xq) + by</m>, and if <m>r\gt 0</m>, <m>r\in S</m>, contradicting the status of <m>d</m> as the least element of <m>S</m>.
			Thus, <m>r = 0</m>, and <m>d|a</m>.
			By a symmetric proof, <m>d|b</m>.

      <p>
      	Suppose then that <m>e</m> is a common divisor of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>; write <m>a = e k_1</m> and <m>b = e k_2</m>.
      	Then <m>d = ax + by = (ek_1)x + (ek_2)y = e(k_1x + k_2 y)</m>, whence <m>e|d</m>.
      	Therefore, <m>d = \gcd(a,b)</m>.

      <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\gcd(a,b) = 1</m>.
        By <xref ref="theorem_bezoutint">Theorem</xref>,
        there are integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that
