    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we'll seek to answer the following questions:
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the Well-Ordering Principle?</li>
      <li>What is mathematical induction, and how can we use it to prove statements about <m>\N</m>?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>

  <introduction>
    <p> In this section we will assume the basic algebraic/arithmetic properties of the integers
      such as closure under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, most of which we will
      formalize via axioms in subsequent sections. <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" /> formalizes the
      familiar notion that nonempty subsets of the positive integers have a smallest element, which
      will be used repeatedly throughout the text. We then explore a closely related idea,
      mathematical induction, via an example and exercises. </p>

    <aside>
      <title>Peano Axioms</title>
      <p> In fact, one can build a model of <m>\N</m> with set theory and the Peano axioms, which
        utilize the notion of a <em>successor</em>--the next natural number. </p>
    </aside>

    <p> A consequence of the Peano postulates is the <em>well-ordering principle</em>, which we
      state as an axiom. </p>

          real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}</m> does not satisfy the well-ordering principle under the
          usual ordering <m>\le</m>, the Well Ordering Axiom asserts that there exists a well
          ordering on <em>any</em> set, including <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. Accepting this axiom is

          of choice</url>.</fn>. </p>
      </statement>
    </axiom>

    <p>
      The Well-Ordering Principle is useful for producing smallest elements of nonempty subsets
      defined to have certain properties, as the following example demonstrates.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <statement>
        <p> In this exploration, we investigate polynomials with real coefficients, as well as their
          degrees. We will define these terms more formally in <xref ref="def_polynomial" />, but
          for now you may use your intuition from previous courses in algebra. </p>
        <p> Let <m>S</m> be the set of all polynomials <m>f</m> in the variable <m>x</m> with real
          coefficients such that <m>f(2) = f(-2) = 0</m> and <m>f(0) = -4</m>. </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Give an example of an <m>f\in S</m> and <m>g\notin S</m>.</li>
          <li>Let <m>D = \{\deg f\mid f\in S\}</m> be the set of possible degrees of polynomials in <m>
            S</m>. Show that <m>D\ne \emptyset</m> and <m>D\subseteq \N_0</m>.</li>
          <li>Apply the Well-Ordering Principle to argue that <m>D</m> has a least element. To what
            does this correspond in <m>S</m>?</li>
        </ol>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Examples vary, but <m>f(x) = x^2-4</m> and <m>g(x) = x+1</m> suffice.</li>
          <li>Since <m>f(x) = x^2 - 4\in S</m>, we see that <m>2\in D</m>. Furthermore, the zero
            polynomial is not in <m>S</m>, so the degrees of polynomials in <m>S</m> are all
            nonnegative integers. Thus, <m>D\subseteq \N_0</m>.</li>
          <li>We see that <m>D</m> meets the conditions of the well-ordering principle, and so it
            has a least element. This least element is the degree of the polynomial of least degree
            satisfying <m>f(2) = f(-2) = 0</m> and <m>f(0) = -4</m>.</li>
        </ol>

      <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
      <statement> 
        <p>Let <m>P(m)</m> be a statement for each <m>m\in \N</m>. Suppose that <ol>
          <li><m>P(1)</m> is true.</li>
          <li>For all <m>k\geq 0</m>, if <m>P(k)</m> is true, then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.</li>
        </ol>
        Then <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>m\in\N_0</m>. 
      </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p> Suppose <m>P(m)</m> is a statement for each <m>m\in\N</m> satisfying both properties
          above. Suppose, for a contradiction, that there exists some <m>m_0\in\N</m> such that <m>
          P(m_0)</m> is not true. Let <m>S = \{m\in\N\mid P(m)\text{ is not true}\}</m>. Then <m>m_0\in
          S</m> by assumption so that <m>S</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>\N</m>. By the
          Well-Ordering Principle <xref ref="axiom_wellordering" />, <m>S</m> has a least element. </p>

        <p> Let <m>k_0\in S</m> be the least element. Since <m>P(1)</m> is true, we know <m>k_0> 1</m>
          and so <m>k_0-1\in\N</m>. Since <m>k_0</m> was the least element we know that <m>k_0-1\notin
          S</m>. Thus <m>P(k_0-1)</m> is true. Since <m>P(k_0-1)</m> is true, the second hypothesis
          tells us <m>P(k_0)</m> is true. This contradicts that <m>P(k_0)</m> is false. Since we
          have arrived at a contradiction, we conclude that <m>P(m)</m> is true for all <m>m\in\N</m>
          .

    <p> Mathematical induction is like climbing an infinite staircase. The <em>base case</em> tells
      us that we can take a first step on the staircase. In the <em>inductive
      hypothesis</em>, we assume we can take all the steps up to a certain height (<m>n</m>). In the <em>inductive
      step</em>, we prove that this allows us to take the <m>(n+1)</m>st step. </p>
    <p> Thus, if we can take step <m>1</m>, we can (by the inductive step) take step <m>2</m>.
      And since we can take step <m>2</m>, we can (again by the inductive step) take step <m>3
      </m>. And so on, forever (or, if the notion of actual infinity makes you uncomfortable, as
      far as we want to go). </p>
    <aside>
    <title>Induction vs Well-Ordering</title>
      <p> It can be proved that the principle of mathematical induction is logically equivalent to
        the well-ordering principle. That is, if we assume either one to be true, we can deduce the
        other. We will generally take the well-ordering principle on <m>\N</m> to be an axiom, and
        treat induction as a theorem. </p>
    </aside>
    <p> The following proposition is often referred to as the Gauss Summation Formula. We will
      employ two proof techniques. The first will be a proof using <xref
        ref="thm_mathematical_induction" /> and the second will be a direct proof. In the inductive
      proof we will introduce some language that is typically used when performing a proof by
      induction. </p>

    <p>
      We choose to give two proofs of the Gauss Summation Formula to illustrate
      that induction is not always the easiest way to prove statements about natural numbers.
      However, it is a crucial tool in algebra and it's important to learn how to use our tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the goal of understanding how to use our tools, we continue with another example of
      induction.
      This example shows how to manipulate inequalities within proofs.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="basic_induction_inequality">
      <statement>
        <p> For all <m>k\ge 1</m>, <m>3^k > k</m>. </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p> Let's start by labelling <m>P(m)</m>. By looking at the statement, <m>P(m)</m> should
          be: <me>
            P(m)\colon 3^m>m.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p> Now that <m>P(m)</m> is clearly labelled, we will prove the base case which is <m>P(1)</m>.
          With our description, we have <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <m>3^1>1</m> which is certainly
          true. This completes the proof of the base case. </p>
        <p> For the inductive step, we suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true and prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is
          also true. Given our description of the statements <m>P(m)</m>, assuming <m>P(k)</m> is
          true is assuming <me>
            3^k>k.
          </me> We now need to use this to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is
          true. That is, we need to show <m>3^{k+1}>k+1</m>. Before we perform computations let's
          also notice that <m>k\ge 1</m>. Now we compute: <md>
            <mrow>3^{k+1} \amp = 3^k\cdot 3^1</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp > k\cdot 3</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = k + 2k </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp > k + 1</mrow>
          </md> where the last inequality follows from <m>k\ge
          1</m> implies <m>2k\ge 2>1</m>. We conclude <m>3^{k+1}>k+1</m> as desired. </p>
        <p> This completes the proof by induction and we conclude <m>3^m>m</m> for all <m>m\in \N</m>

      <introduction>
        <p> Here you will try out an inductive proof on your own. You'll be guided through a proof
          of the statement: For every <m>n\in \N</m>
        <me>1^2+2^2+3^2+\cdots + (n-1)^2+n^2 =
          \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.</me> That is, the sum of the first <m>n</m> squares can be
          computed as <m>\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</m>. </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p> Identify what <m>P(n)</m> is and verify <m>P(1)</m> is true. </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p> The statement <m>P(n)</m> is the equation in the statement for a given <m>n</m>. </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>P(n)</m> is the statement <m>1^2+2^2+\cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</m>. </p>
          <p> Thus <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <m>1^2 = \frac{1(1+1)(2+1)}{6}</m> which is
            certainly true. </p>
        </answer>

        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p> We first assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true. This means <men xml:id="sum-of-squares">
            1^2+2^2+\cdots + k^2 = \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}.
            </men> We need to show
            somehow that <me>
              1^2+2^2+\cdots + k^2+(k+1)^2 = \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)}{6}.
