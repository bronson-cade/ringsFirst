    <ul>
      <li>What are primes? What properties do they have?</li>

      As described in <xref ref="sec-induction-wellordering" text="custom">Section 1.1</xref>,
      our main goal is to build a deep structural understanding of the notion of <em>factorization</em>.
      That is, splitting objects (e.g., numbers,
      polynomials, matrices) into products of other objects.
      One of the most familiar examples of this process involves factoring integers into products of primes.

        <p>
          Let <m>p > 1</m> be a natural number.
          We say <m>p</m> is <term>prime</term>
          if whenever <m>a,b\in \Z</m> such that <m>p\mid ab</m>,
          either <m>p\mid a</m> or <m>p\mid b</m>.

          A natural number <m>m > 1</m> is said to be

    <p>
    	This is almost certainly not the definition of prime that you are familiar with from your school days, which likely said something to the effect that a prime <m>p > 1</m> is a natural number only divisible by 1 and itself.
    	However, <xref ref="def_primeinteger" /> is often more useful than the usual definition.
    	And, as <xref ref="thm_euclidslemma" /> demonstrates, the two notions are equivalent.

    <lemma xml:id="thm_euclidslemma">
    	<title>Euclid's Lemma</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given any <m>p\in \N</m>, <m>p > 1</m>,
          <m>p</m> is prime if and only if whenever <m>m\in \N</m> divides <m>p</m>,
          either <m>m = p</m> or <m>m = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>p</m> be prime and suppose <m>m\in \N</m> divides <m>p</m>,
        so <m>p = mk</m> for some <m>k\in \N</m>.
        By definition, <m>p|m</m> or <m>p|k</m>.
        If <m>p|m</m>, then <m>pj = m</m>, so <m>p = pjk</m>,
        and <m>jk=1</m>, which means <m>j=k=1</m> and thus <m>m=p</m>.
        If <m>p|k</m>, then <m>pj=k</m>,
        so <m>p = mpj</m>, and <m>mj=1</m>, so <m>m = j = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, assume <m>p\in \N</m> has the property that whenever an integer <m>m</m> exists with <m>m|p</m>,
        then <m>m= p</m> or <m>m =1</m>.
        Suppose <m>p|ab</m>,
        so there exists a <m>k\in\N</m> such that <m>pk = ab</m>.
        Note that if <m>\gcd(a,p) = d > 1</m>,
        then <m>d|p</m>, and so <m>d = p</m>, and then <m>p|a</m>.
        If <m>\gcd(a,p) = 1</m>,
        then by B&#xe9;zout's Identity there are integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>ax + py = 1</m>,
        so we may multiply by <m>b</m> to obtain <m>abx + pby = b</m>,
        whence <m>p|b</m>.

    <remark>
    		<p>
    			How does your definition treat the number 1? 
    			The primality of 1 has been the subject of much debate stretching back to the Greeks (most of whom did not consider 1 to be a number). 
    			Throughout history, mathematicians have at times viewed 1 as prime, and at other times, not prime.
    			The main argument for the non-primality of 1 is that if 1 were taken to be prime, we would need to word theorems like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (below) in such a way that only prime factorizations not including 1 can be considered. For, if 1 is prime, we would have to consider, e.g., <m>6 = 2\cdot 3 = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 1\cdot 1\cdot 2\cdot 3</m> as three different factorizations of 6 into primes.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			However, neither is 1 composite (your definition should rule this out in some way).
    			Instead, we call 1 a <term>unit</term>, which we'll explore more fully in <xref ref="def-unit" /> and the following; consequently, the opposite of "prime" is not "composite", but "not prime".

    <theorem>

        <p>
          Let <m>a\in \N</m> such that <m>a > 1</m>.
          Then there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>p\mid a</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We proceed by mathematical induction.
        Note that when <m>a = 2</m>, the statement holds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that there is a <m>k\in\N</m> such that for all <m>a\le k</m>,
        the statement holds.
        Consider <m>k+1</m>.
        If <m>k+1</m> is prime, we are done.
        If not, then <m>k+1</m> is composite,
        and by the answer to <xref ref="question_compositecharacterization">Question</xref>,
        there are integers <m>a,b\ne 1</m> such that <m>k+1 = ab</m>.
        By induction,
        there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>p|a</m>, so <m>p|k+1</m>.

    		</statement>
    		<proof>
          Since <m>p\mid q</m>, we know <m>\gcd(p,q) = p>1</m>. By <xref ref="thm_euclidslemma">Euclid's Lemma</xref>, 
          the only possible divisors of <m>q</m> are <m>1,q</m>. It follows that <m>p=q</m>.

      Our first major theorem makes two claims:
      that positive integers greater than 1 <em>can</em>
      be factored into products of primes,
      and that this factorization can happen in only one way.
      As the semester progresses, we will see other theorems like this one,
      and catch glimpses of other ways to think about the
      <em>unique factorization property</em>.

      <statement>
        <p>
           Every natural number <m>n > 1</m> is either a prime number or it can be expressed as a finite product of prime numbers.
          That is, for every natural number <m>n > 1</m>,
          there exist primes <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots,
          p_m</m> and natural numbers <m>r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m</m> such that
          <me>
            n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}
          </me>.

      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Induction!
        </p>
      </hint>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        It is enough to show that,
        if <m>n > 1</m>, we may write <m>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k</m>,
        where the <m>p_i</m>'s are not necessarily distinct primes.
        Then we can collect the common primes and write them with exponent notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when <m>n = 2</m>, there is such an expression,
        so let <m>k > 2</m> be the least positive integer that fails to be expressed as above.
        We note that <m>k</m> cannot be prime,
        or it could be expressed as above.
        Thus, by Theorem 2.1, there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>k = p b</m>,
        where <m>1 \lt p, b \lt k</m>.
        Since <m>k</m> was the least positive integer that cannot be factored as a product of primes,
        <m>b</m> has a prime factorization.
        But then so does <m>k</m>, a contradiction.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> and <m>q_1, q_2,\ldots,
          q_n</m> all be primes and let <m>k</m> be a natural number such that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \ldots q_n</m>.
          Then <m>p = q_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first state a claim that will be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Claim 1:</em> If <m>p,q</m> are primes such that <m>p|q</m>,
        then <m>p = q</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proof of Claim 1:</em> Since
        <m>p,
        q > 1</m> and both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are prime,
        <m>p = q</m> by the definition of primality.
        <m>\checkmark</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>pk = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n = (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}) q_n</m>.
        If <m>p|q_n</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        If not, the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p| q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-1}</m>.
        If <m>p|q_{n-1}</m>, we're done by Claim 1.
        Otherwise, <m>p|q_1 q_2 \cdots q_{n-2}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeating this process,
        we see that either <m>p|q_i</m> for some <m>i > 2</m>,
        or <m>p|q_1 q_2</m>.
        Now the definition of a prime guarantees that <m>p|q_1</m> or <m>p|q_2</m>,
        in which case Claim 1 requires that <m>p = q_1</m> or <m>p = q_2</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <theorem xml:id="theorem_FTAuniqueness">
    	<title>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic<ndash/>Uniqueness Part</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
           Let <m>n</m> be a natural number.
          Let <m>\set{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m}</m> and
          <m>\set{q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_s}</m> be sets of primes with
          <m>p_i\ne p_j</m> if <m>i\ne j</m> and <m>q_i\ne q_j</m> if <m>i\ne j</m>.
          Let <m>\set{r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_m}</m> and
          <m>\set{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_s}</m> be sets of natural numbers such that
          <md>
            <mrow>n \amp = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = q_1^{t_1} q_2^{t_2} \cdots q_s^{t_s}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <m>m = s</m> and <m>\set{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m} = \set{q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_s}</m>.
          That is, the sets of primes are equal but their elements are not necessarily listed in the same order (i.e., <m>p_i</m> may or may not equal <m>q_i</m>).
          Moreover, if <m>p_i = q_j</m>, then <m>r_i = t_j</m>.
          In other words,
          if we express the same natural number as a product of distinct primes,
          then the expressions are identical except for the ordering of the factors.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Argue that the two sets are equal (how do we do that?).
          Then argue that the exponents must also be equal.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Without loss of generality,
        assume <m>p_1 \lt  p_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  p_m</m> and <m>q_1 \lt  q_2 \lt  \cdots \lt  q_s</m>.
        Given a <m>p_i</m>,
        we know that <m>p_i | q_1^{t_1} q_2^{t_2} \cdots q_s^{t_s}</m>,
        which implies that <m>p_i | q_j</m> for some <m>j</m> by Claim 2 in the proof of Lemma 2.8.
        Further, Lemma 2.8 implies that <m>p_i = q_j</m>, and similarly,
        given a <m>q_j</m>, <m>q_j = p_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Thus, <m>m =s</m>,
        and by the ordering of the <m>p_i</m>'s and <m>q_j</m>'s, we have <m>p_i = q_j</m>,
        <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, m</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me>
          n = p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m} = p_1^{t_1} p_2^{t_2} \cdots p_m^{t_m}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, assume by way of contradiction,
        that <m>r_i \ne t_i</m> for some <m>i</m>.
        Without loss of generality, we may assume <m>r_i \lt  t_i</m>.
        Then <m>p_i^{t_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_m^{r_m}</m>,
        which implies that
        <me>
          p_i^{t_i - r_i} | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots \hat{p}_i^{r_i} \cdots p_m^{r_m}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>t_i - r_i > 0</m>, we have that
        <me>
          p_i  | p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots \hat{p}_i^{r_i} \cdots p_m^{r_m}
        </me>,
        from which <m>p_i | p_j</m> for some <m>j\ne i</m> by Lemma 2.8.
        This is a contradiction,
        so <m>r_i = t_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, m</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    
    <p>
    		Our first major result is in hand: we can factor natural numbers <m>n > 2</m> uniquely as a product of primes.
    		Much of the rest of this book seeks to deduce a generalization of this result that relies on structural arithmetic properties enjoyed by <m>\Z</m> and similar objects.
