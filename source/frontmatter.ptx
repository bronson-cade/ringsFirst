      This textbook aims to provide a rings first introduction to abstract algebra. At my institution, 
      we teach ring and field theory before group theory. There are great inquiry based books available 
      that follow this path; however, there are not many options for more traditional courses. This textbook 
      is an attempt to provide such an option.

      I always enjoy telling my students the parable of the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">blind people and the elephant</url>. 
      In these notes, I attempt to describe my part of the elephant. It is, however, only my part of the elephant. If you feel like something could be said differently or 
      better please reach out.

      This work is adapted from <url href="https://ringswithinquiry.org/">Rings with Inquiry</url>.
      However, it is not an inquiry based learning textbook. Additionally, any mistakes 
      are my own.
