    <p> 
      We now begin the process of abstraction. We will do this in stages, beginning with the
      concept of a <em>field</em>. First, we need to formally define some familiar sets of numbers.

        <p> The rational numbers, denoted by <m>\Q</m>, is the set <me>
            \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}\mid a,b\in \Z, \ b\ne 0\right\}
          </me>. </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p> Recall that in elementary school, you learned that two fractions <m>\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}
      \in \Q</m> are equivalent if and only if <m>ad=bc</m>. </p>

      <idx>real numbers</idx> We likely have an intuitive idea of what is meant by <m>\R</m>, the
      set of real numbers. Defining <m>\R</m> rigorously is actually quite difficult, and occupies a
      significant amount of time in a first course in real analysis. Thus, we will make use of your
      intuition. </p>

    <p> It is worth noting that <m>\N\subseteq \Z\subseteq \Q\subseteq \R</m>, but <m>\R</m> also
      contains many irrational numbers, such as <m>\pi</m>, <m>e</m>, <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and so on. </p>

    <p> Out of <m>\R</m> we may build the complex numbers. </p>

          part</term> of <m>z</m> and <m>b</m> is the <term>imaginary part</term>. The set of

    <p> 
      <em>Algebra</em> comes from an Arabic word meaning <q>the reunion of broken parts</q>. We
      therefore need a way of combining two elements of a set into one; we turn to a particular type
      of function, known as a binary operation, to accomplish this.

    <p> The hallmark of modern pure mathematics is the use of <em>axioms</em>. An axiom is
      essentially an unproved assertion of truth. Our use of axioms serves several purposes. </p>
    <p> From a logical perspective, axioms help us avoid the problem of infinite regression (e.g.,
      asking <em>How do you know?</em> over and over again). That is, axioms give us very clear
      starting points from which to make our deductions. </p>
    <!--<p>
    More generally,
    the use of any hypotheses when asking mathematical or scientific questions is a form of creativity,
    and even <em>play</em>.
    God has created us in His image,
    and he is a creative being.
    The definitions we make and the theorems we prove are reflections of the
    <em>imago Dei</em> in us.
    Of course, we do not have the power to create <em>ex nihilo</em>;
    instead, our tools are the mathematical <em>aspects</em>
    God has imbued in his creation.
    We can postulate structures with whichever axioms we like,
    but our creativity is most valuable if it reflects the world <em>as it is</em>.
  </p>-->
    <p>
      To that end,
      our first abstract algebraic structure captures and axiomatizes familiar behavior about how
      numbers can be combined to produce other numbers of the same type.

        The first whispers of a field were known to Lagrange in 1770. However, it was not until 1893 that a formal definition 
        of an abstract field was given. This definition is due to Heinrich Martin Weber in 
        the paper <em>Die allgemeinen Grundlagen der Galois'schen Gleichungstheorie</em>. Weber was a German mathematician known for 
        contributions to the fields of algebra, number theory, and analysis.

      mathematical objects are and are not fields. Notice that you have been working with fields for
      years and that our abstraction of language to that of fields is simply to allow us to explore
      the common features at the same time - it is inefficient to prove the same statement about
      every single field when we can prove it once and for all about fields in general. </p>

          <p> Assume <m>0, 0'</m> both satisfy the additive identity axiom. Observe that <m>0 = 0 +
            0'
              = 0'</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> As <m>0 = 0 + 0</m>, we may write <m>a\cdot 0 = a\cdot (0 + 0) = a\cdot 0 + a \cdot 0</m>.
            Now add the additive inverse of <m>a\cdot 0</m> to both sides to obtain <m>0 = a \cdot 0
            =
              0\cdot a</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Let <m>a\in F</m> and suppose <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are such that <m>a+c = 0</m> and <m>a+b
            = 0</m>. Then <m>a+c = a+b</m>, and we may add <m>b</m> (or <m>c</m>) to both sides to
            obtain <m>b+(a+b) = (b+a)+b = 0 + b = b</m> and <m>c+(a+c) = (c+a)+c = 0 + c = c</m>.
            Thus <m>
              b=c</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Suppose <m>1</m> and <m>1'</m> are multiplicative identities. Then <m>1 = 1 \cdot 1' =
            1'</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Let <m>a\in F</m> be nonzero and suppose <m>b,c</m> are multiplicative inverses for <m>
            a</m>. Then <m>ab = 1 = ac</m>, and we may multiply by <m>b</m> (or <m>c</m>) to obtain <m>b(ab)
            = (ba)b = 1\cdot b = b = b(ac) = (ba)c = 1\cdot c = c</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Observe that <m>(-1) + 1 = 0</m> by the definition of additive inverses. Multiply both
            sides by <m>-1</m> and distribute to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1)\cdot 1 = (-1)\cdot 0</m>.
            By part 2 of this theorem and the definition of a multiplicative identity, we obtain <m>(-1)(-1)
            + (-1) = 0</m>. We now add the multiplicative identity to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1) + 1
            =
              0 + 1</m>, which simplifies to <m>(-1)(-1) = 1</m>. </p>

        </li>

      </ol>
    </proof>
    <p> One consequence of <xref ref="thm_fieldproperties" /> is that, given <m>a\in F</m>, <m>b\in
      F\setminus \set{0}</m>, we may refer to <m>-a</m> as <em>the</em> additive inverse of <m>a</m>,
      and <m>b^{-1}</m> as <em>the</em> multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m>. We will thus employ this
      familiar terminology henceforth. Moreover, we will define <term>subtraction</term> in a field
      as <m>a-b = a+(-b)</m> and division as <m>a/b = a\cdot b^{-1}</m>. </p>

      <title>Subfield Test</title>

        <p> Let <m>K</m> be a field and <m>F\subseteq K</m> be a subset of <m>K</m> such that: <ul>

    Then <m>F</m> is a field under the addition and multiplication in <m>K</m>. In particular, <m>F</m>
    is a subfield of <m>K</m>. </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  <proof>
      <p> We check all of the axioms in <xref ref="def_field" />. Since <m>F</m> is closed under
    subtraction, <m>1_K-1_K=0_K\in F</m>. Since <m>0_K\in F</m> and <m>F</m> is closed under
    subtraction, we have <m>-a=0_K-a\in F</m> for any <m>a\in F</m>. Thus <m>F</m> is closed under
    additive inverses. Since <m>F</m> is closed under additive inverses and subtraction we have <m>a+b
    = a-(-b)\in F</m> for any <m>a,b\in F</m>. Thus <m>F</m> is closed under addition. </p>
      <p> We now turn to the associativity and commutative properties. For any <m>a,b,c\in F</m> we
    know <m>a,b,c\in K</m>. Since addition in <m>K</m> is associative, we know <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m>.
    Thus addition in <m>F</m> is associative. We say it is <em>inherited</em> from <m>K</m>.
    Similarly addition in <m>F</m> is commutative, <m>0_K</m> is the additive identity,
    multiplication is associative and commutative, <m>1_K</m> is the multiplicative identity, and
    the distributive laws hold. </p>
      <p> Lastly, since <m>F</m> is closed under division and <m>1_K\in F</m>, for any <m>b\in F</m>
    we have <m>1_K/b\in F</m> and so the multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m> is in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>
    F</m> is closed under taking multiplicative inverses. This completes the checks of each of the
    10 axioms. </p>
