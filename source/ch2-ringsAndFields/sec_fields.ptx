    <title>Number Systems</title>

    <p> 
      We now begin the process of abstraction. We will do this in stages, beginning with the
      concept of a <em>field</em>. First, we need to formally define some familiar sets of numbers. 
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_rationalNumbers">
      <notation>
        <usage>\Q</usage>
        <description>Rational Numbers</description>
      </notation>
      <idx><h>Rational Numbers</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p> The <em>rational numbers</em>, denoted by <m>\Q</m>, is the set <me>
            \Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b}\mid a,b\in \Z, \ b\ne 0\right\}
          </me>. 
          The symbol is <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is a <em>fraction</em> and we regard two symbols 
          <m>\frac{a}{b},\frac{c}{d}\in \Q</m> as defining the same element if and only if 
          <m>ad = bc</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>


    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p> Prove that the relation defined in <xref ref="def_rationalNumbers"/>
          is an equivalence relation. Recall <xref ref="def-eqrel" />. </p>
      </statement>
    </activity>

    <proposition xml:id="prop_arithmeticInQ">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>\frac{a}{b},\frac{c}{d}\in\Q</m>, the sum and product: 
          <me>\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}\text{ and }\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}</me>
          is well-defined.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We only show the product is well-defined, while the sum is left as an exercise. To be well-defined, 
          we need to argue that for any equivalent ways of representing both fractions in the product, the result is unchanged. 
          To that end, take <m>\frac{a}{b},\frac{a'}{b'},\frac{c}{d},\frac{c'}{d'}\in\Q</m>. Suppose that <m>ab'=a'b</m> and <m>cd' = c'd</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then 
          <md>
            <mrow> \frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d}\amp= \frac{ac}{bd}</mrow>
            <mrow> \frac{a'}{b'}\cdot \frac{c'}{d'}\amp= \frac{a'c'}{b'd'}</mrow>
          </md>
          and we need to show that <m>\frac{ac}{bd}</m> is equivalent to <m>\frac{a'c'}{b'd'}</m> or that <m> acb'd' = a'c'bd</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We have
          <md>
            <mrow> acb'd' \amp= (ab')(cd') </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a'b)(c'd) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= a'c'bd </mrow>
          </md>
          as desired.
        </p>

      <idx>real numbers</idx> We likely have an intuitive idea of what is meant by <m>\R</m>, the
      set of real numbers. Defining <m>\R</m> rigorously is actually quite difficult, and occupies a
      significant amount of time in a first course in real analysis. Thus, we will make use of your
      intuition. </p>

    <p> It is worth noting that <m>\N\subseteq \Z\subseteq \Q\subseteq \R</m>, but <m>\R</m> also
      contains many irrational numbers, such as <m>\pi</m>, <m>e</m>, <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and so on. </p>

    <p> Out of <m>\R</m> we may build the complex numbers. </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_complexNumbers">

        <description>Complex Numbers</description>
      </notation>
      <idx>Complex Numbers</idx>
      <statement>
        <p> The <term>complex numbers</term> consist of all expressions of the form <m>a+bi</m>,
          where <m>a,b\in
            \R</m> and <m>i^2 = -1</m>. Given <m>z = a+bi</m>, we say <m>a</m> is the <term>real
          part</term> of <m>z</m> and <m>b</m> is the <term>imaginary part</term>. The set of
          complex numbers is denoted <m>\C</m>. </p>
          <p>
            Addition and multiplication in <m>\C</m> is defined in the usual way:
            <md>
              <mrow>(a_1+b_1i)+(a_2+b_2i)\amp= (a_1+a_2)+(b_1+b_2)i </mrow>
              <mrow>(a_1+b_1i)\cdot (a_2+b_2i)\amp= (a_1a_2-b_1b_2)+(a_1b_2+a_2b_1)i</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Unlike <m>\Q</m>, the elements of <m>\C</m> are not equivalence classes and so we do not need an analogue of 
      <xref ref="prop_arithmeticInQ"/> here.

    <title>Binary Operations</title>

    <p> 
      <em>Algebra</em> comes from an Arabic word meaning <q>the reunion of broken parts</q>. We
      therefore need a way of combining two elements of a set into one; we turn to a particular type
      of function, known as a binary operation, to accomplish this.

    <title>Fields</title>

    <p> The hallmark of modern pure mathematics is the use of <em>axioms</em>. An axiom is
      essentially an unproved assertion of truth. Our use of axioms serves several purposes. </p>
    <p> From a logical perspective, axioms help us avoid the problem of infinite regression (e.g.,
      asking <em>How do you know?</em> over and over again). That is, axioms give us very clear
      starting points from which to make our deductions. </p>
    <!--<p>
    More generally,
    the use of any hypotheses when asking mathematical or scientific questions is a form of creativity,
    and even <em>play</em>.
    God has created us in His image,
    and he is a creative being.
    The definitions we make and the theorems we prove are reflections of the
    <em>imago Dei</em> in us.
    Of course, we do not have the power to create <em>ex nihilo</em>;
    instead, our tools are the mathematical <em>aspects</em>
    God has imbued in his creation.
    We can postulate structures with whichever axioms we like,
    but our creativity is most valuable if it reflects the world <em>as it is</em>.
  </p>-->
    <p>
      To that end,
      our first abstract algebraic structure captures and axiomatizes familiar behavior about how
      numbers can be combined to produce other numbers of the same type.

        The first whispers of a field were known to Lagrange in 1770. However, it was not until 1893 that a formal definition 
        of an abstract field was given. This definition is due to Heinrich Martin Weber in 
        the paper <em>Die allgemeinen Grundlagen der Galois'schen Gleichungstheorie</em>. Weber was a German mathematician known for 
        contributions to the fields of algebra, number theory, and analysis.

    <p> In the <xref ref="exer_fieldexamples" />, you determined which of sets of familiar
      mathematical objects are and are not fields. Notice that you have been working with fields for
      years and that our abstraction of language to that of fields is simply to allow us to explore
      the common features at the same time - it is inefficient to prove the same statement about
      every single field when we can prove it once and for all about fields in general. </p>

    <title>Examples of Fields</title>
    <p>
      We will now provide more rigorous arguments that the fields investigated are in fact fields.
      We will do so by checking, for a handful of the fields investigated, each of the axioms hold. 
      At the end of the section we will introduce a way of simplyfying some of our work.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Rational Numbers are a Field</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Having already shown that addition and multiplication are well-defined in <xref ref="prop_arithmeticInQ"/>. We show that, equipped 
          with these binary operations, <m>\Q</m> forms a field. Take <m>\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}, \frac{e}{f}\in \Q</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with the additive checks: associativity, commutativity, additive identity, and additive inverses. For associativity we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{b} + \left(\frac{c}{d}+\frac{e}{f}\right) \amp= \frac{a}{b} + \left(\frac{cf+de}{cf}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{a(cf)+b(cf+de)}{b(cf)}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{acf + bcf+bde}{bcf} </mrow>
          </md>
          where we have dropped the parentheses in the numerator as multiplication in <m>\Z</m> is associative. We also have
          <md>
            <mrow>\left(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}\right)+\frac{e}{f} \amp= \frac{ac+bd}{bd} + \frac{e}{f}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{(ac+bd)f+bd(e)}{b(cf)}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{acf+bcf+bde}{bcf} </mrow>
          </md>
          and this is the same as the other association.
        </p>
        <p>
          For commutativity we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{b} +\frac{c}{d} \amp= \frac{ad+bc}{bd} </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{c}{d} +\frac{a}{b} \amp= \frac{cb+da}{db} </mrow>
          </md>
          But in <m>\Z</m> we know that <m>db = bd</m> and <m>ad+bc=cb+da</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The element <m>\frac{0}{1}\in\Q</m> is the additive identity as 
          <me>\frac{0}{1}+\frac{a}{b} = \frac{0\cdot b + 1\cdot a}{1\cdot b} = \frac{a}{b}</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The additive inverse of <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is <m>\frac{-a}{b}</m> as:
          <me>\frac{a}{b} + \frac{-a}{b} = \frac{ab+b(-a)}{b^2} = \frac{0}{b^2}.</me>
          And <m>\frac{0}{1} = \frac{0}{b^2}</m> as <m>0\cdot b^2=1\cdot 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now turn to the multiplicative axioms: associativity, commutativity, identity, inverses of non-zero elements. 
          For associativity:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{b}\cdot\left(\frac{c}{d}\cdot \frac{e}{f}\right) \amp= \frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{ce}{df} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{a(ce)}{b(df)}</mrow>
            <mrow> \left(\frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{c}{d}\right) \cdot \frac{e}{f} \amp= \frac{ac}{bd}\cdot \frac{e}{f} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{(ac)e)}{(bd)f}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{a(ce)}{b(df)}</mrow>
          </md>
          where the last line uses associativity of multiplication in <m>\Z</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For commutativity we again use that the property holds in <m>\Z</m>:
          <me>\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd} = \frac{ca}{db} = \frac{c}{d}\cdot \frac{a}{b}.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplicative identity is <m>\frac{1}{1}</m> as 
          <me>\frac{1}{1}\cdot \frac{a}{b} = \frac{1\cdot a}{1\cdot b} = \frac{a}{b}.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly we have the left and right-distributive axioms. For the left-distributive axiom we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{b}\cdot\left(\frac{c}{d}+\frac{e}{f}\right) \amp= \frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{cf+de}{df} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=\frac{a(cf+de)}{b(df)} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{acf+ade}{bdf} </mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d} + \frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{e}{f} \amp= \frac{ac}{bd} + \frac{ae}{bf} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{acbf+bdae}{b^2df}</mrow>
          </md>
          Now notice that <m>\frac{acbf + bdae}{b^2df} = \frac{acf+ade}{bdf}</m> as 
          <me>(acbf+bdae)(bdf) = b^2df(acf+ade).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a consequence of the axioms that left and right-distributivity are equivalent, see exercise ????. We show how 
          to prove this exercise in this example:
          <md>
            <mrow> \left(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}\right)\cdot \frac{e}{f}\amp= \frac{e}{f}\cdot\left(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}\right) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{e}{f}\cdot \frac{a}{b} + \frac{e}{f}\cdot \frac{c}{d} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{e}{f} + \frac{c}{d}\cdot \frac{e}{d} </mrow>
          </md>
          where the first and third equality is commutativity of multiplication and the second is the left-distributive property.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      This was quite involved but we managed it. This was our first check that a set with one or more binary operations satisfied a sequence of axioms.
      These types of checks will continue throughout the course and so we will spend quite some time developing procedural fluency in carrying out definition checks.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Complex Numbers Form a Field</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Complex Numbers <xref ref="def_complexNumbers"/> form a field under their usual multiplication and addition. The operations are well-defined and 
          so now we need to check all ten axioms. We leave a handful of them to the reader as they are not necessarily difficult but they are tedious.
          Take <m>a+bi, c+di, e+fi\in\C</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We leave the proof of associativity as an exercise, as well as the proof that the additive identity is <m>0+0i</m> and the additive inverse of <m>a+bi</m> is 
          <m>(-a)+(-b)i</m>. We will prove that addition is commutative:
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+bi) + (c+di) \amp= (a+c) + (b+d)i </mrow>
            <mrow>(c+di) + (a+bi) \amp= (c+a) + (d+b)i </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a+c) + (b+d)i</mrow>
          </md>
          as <m>a,b,c,d\in \R</m> and addition of real numbers is commutative.
        </p>
        <p>
          We leave the proof of associativity as a worthy yet tedious exercise. We will prove the remaining axioms. For commutativity:
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+bi)\cdot(c+di) \amp= (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i </mrow>
            <mrow> (c+di)\cdot (a+bi) \amp= (ca-db) + (cb+da)i </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i </mrow>
          </md>
          where have used the multiplication of real numbers is commutative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplicative identity is <m>1+0i</m>:
          <me>(a+bi)\cdot(1+0i) = (a\cdot 1-b\cdot 0) + (a\cdot 0 + b\cdot 1)i = a+bi</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplicative inverse of a non-zero <m>a+bi</m> is <m>\frac{a}{a^2+b^2} + \frac{-b}{a^2+b^2}i</m>.
          Since <m>a+bi\neq 0+0i</m>, <m>a^2+b^2>0</m> and so this complex number is well-defined. We leave it as an exercise to verify:
          <me>(a+bi)\cdot \left(\frac{a}{a^2+b^2} + \frac{-b}{a^2+b^2}i\right) = 1 + 0i</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We've already seen an instance of the left-distributive property implying the right-distributive property. Since you will 
          prove this in Exer???? we only show the left-distributive property:
          <md>
            <mrow> \amp (a+bi)\cdot( (c+di) + (e+fi))</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a+bi)\cdot( (c+e)+(d+f)i)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a(c+e)-b(d+f)) + (a(d+f)+b(c+e))i</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ac+ae-bd-bf) + (ad+af+bc+be)i</mrow>
          </md>
          and
          <md>
             <mrow> \amp (a+bi)\cdot (c+di) + (a+bi)\cdot (e+fi)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= ((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i) + ((ae-bf) + (af+be)i)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ac-bd) + (ae-bf) + ( (ad+bc) + (af+be))i</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ac+ae-bd-bf) + (ad+af+bc+be)i</mrow>
          </md>
          These agree and completes the proof of the left-distributive property and that <m>\C</m> is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>


    <p>
      The next example is a finite example. In particular, we will return to <xref ref="def_integersModm"/> and prove that 
      the integers modulo <m>m</m> form a field if and only if <m>m</m> is prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the proof, we recall that addition and multiplication is associative and commutative was done in exercises ????. The additive 
      identity is <m>\bar{0}</m> as <m>\bar{0}+\bar{a} = \overline{0+a} = \bar{a}</m>. The additive inverse of <m>\bar{a}</m> is <m>\overline{-a}</m>.
      The multiplicative identity is <m>\bar{1}</m> as <m>\bar{1}\cdot \bar{a} = \overline{1\cdot a} = \bar{a}</m>. That multiplication 
      distributes over addition was also done in exercise???. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, <m>\Z/m</m> satisfies all the axioms of being a field with the exception of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements.
      In the proof that follows we show this happens if and only if <m>m</m> is prime.
    </p>


    <theorem xml:id="thm-integersModmField">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Fix <m>p>1</m> in <m>\N</m>. Then <m>\Z/p</m>, with modular addition and multiplication, is a field if and only if <m>p</m> is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By the discussion preceeding the theorem statement, we need only check that multiplicative inverses exist to see that <m>\Z/p</m> is a field. 
          To that end, suppose <m>p</m> is prime. Take <m>\bar{0}\ne \bar{a}\in\Z/p</m>. Since <m>p</m> is prime, <m>\gcd(a,p) = 1,p</m>. If <m>\gcd(a,p) = p</m>, 
          then <m>\bar{a} = \bar{0}</m> which isn't true. Thus <m>\gcd(a,p) = 1</m>. By <xref ref="thm_bezoutIdentity"/>, there exists <m>x,y\in\Z</m> with
          <me>
            ax+py=1.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\bar{p} = \bar{0}</m>, after reducing modulo <m>p</m> we have 
          <me>\bar{a}\cdot \bar{x} = \bar{1}</me>
          and in particular <m>\bar{x}</m> is the multiplicative inverse of <m>\bar{a}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>p</m> is not prime, then there exists <m>a,b\in\mathbb{N}</m> with <m>p=ab</m> and <m>1\le a,b\le p</m>. 
          Then <m>\bar{a}\cdot \bar{b} = \bar{p} = \bar{0}</m>. And since <m>1\leq a,b\leq p</m>, we have <m>\bar{a},\bar{b}\neq \bar{0}</m>.
          If <m>\Z/p</m> was a field, then <m>\bar{a}</m> has a multiplicative inverse, say <m>\bar{a}^{-1}</m>. Then
          <md>
            <mrow>\bar{a}\bar{b} \amp= \bar{0} </mrow>
            <mrow>\bar{a}^{-1}\cdot(\bar{a}\bar{b}) \amp= \bar{a}^{-1}\cdot \bar{0} </mrow>
            <mrow>(\bar{a}^{-1}\cdot\bar{a})\bar{b} \amp= \bar{0} </mrow>
            <mrow> \bar{1}\cdot \bar{b}\amp= \bar{0} </mrow>
            <mrow> \bar{b}\amp= \bar{0} </mrow>
          </md>
          which contradicts <m>\bar{b}\ne \bar{0}</m>. We conclude the non-zero element <m>\bar{a}</m> does not have a multiplicative inverse and 
          so when <m>p</m> is not prime <m>\Z/p</m> is not a field.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Notice that when <m>p</m> is prime <m>\Z/p</m> is a field and it has only finitely many elements. This is such an important field, we will give a 
      proper definition.

      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>p</m> a prime, we denote by <m>\mathbb{F}_p</m> the finite field <m>\Z/p</m> and call it the <em>finite field of order</em> <m>p</m>.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> Assume <m>0, 0'</m> both satisfy the additive identity axiom. Observe that <m>0 = 0 +
            0'
              = 0'</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> As <m>0 = 0 + 0</m>, we may write <m>a\cdot 0 = a\cdot (0 + 0) = a\cdot 0 + a \cdot 0</m>.
            Now add the additive inverse of <m>a\cdot 0</m> to both sides to obtain <m>0 = a \cdot 0
            =
              0\cdot a</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Let <m>a\in F</m> and suppose <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are such that <m>a+c = 0</m> and <m>a+b
            = 0</m>. Then <m>a+c = a+b</m>, and we may add <m>b</m> (or <m>c</m>) to both sides to
            obtain <m>b+(a+b) = (b+a)+b = 0 + b = b</m> and <m>c+(a+c) = (c+a)+c = 0 + c = c</m>.
            Thus <m>
              b=c</m>. </p>

          <p> Suppose <m>1</m> and <m>1'</m> are multiplicative identities. Then <m>1 = 1 \cdot 1' =

        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Let <m>a\in F</m> be nonzero and suppose <m>b,c</m> are multiplicative inverses for <m>
            a</m>. Then <m>ab = 1 = ac</m>, and we may multiply by <m>b</m> (or <m>c</m>) to obtain <m>b(ab)
            = (ba)b = 1\cdot b = b = b(ac) = (ba)c = 1\cdot c = c</m>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Observe that <m>(-1) + 1 = 0</m> by the definition of additive inverses. Multiply both
            sides by <m>-1</m> and distribute to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1)\cdot 1 = (-1)\cdot 0</m>.
            By part 2 of this theorem and the definition of a multiplicative identity, we obtain <m>(-1)(-1)
            + (-1) = 0</m>. We now add the multiplicative identity to obtain <m>(-1)(-1) + (-1) + 1
            =
              0 + 1</m>, which simplifies to <m>(-1)(-1) = 1</m>. </p>

        </li>

      </ol>
    </proof>
    <p> One consequence of <xref ref="thm_fieldproperties" /> is that, given <m>a\in F</m>, <m>b\in
      F\setminus \set{0}</m>, we may refer to <m>-a</m> as <em>the</em> additive inverse of <m>a</m>,
      and <m>b^{-1}</m> as <em>the</em> multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m>. We will thus employ this
      familiar terminology henceforth. Moreover, we will define <term>subtraction</term> in a field
      as <m>a-b = a+(-b)</m> and division as <m>a/b = a\cdot b^{-1}</m>. </p>

      One source for new fields is to look within the fields we already have. That is, we want to
    know when a subset of a field is a field in its own right.

    Many of the number sets with which you are familiar are fields. <theorem>

        <p> The set of complex numbers <m>\mathbb{C}</m> is an extension field of <m>\R</m>.

  <p>
    The last theorem in this section gives us a technique for identifying subfields of a given
    field.
    </p>
  <theorem
      xml:id="thm_subfieldTest">
      <title>Subfield Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p> Let <m>K</m> be a field and <m>F\subseteq K</m> be a subset of <m>K</m> such that: <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>1_K\in F</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> For any <m>a,b\in F</m>, we have <m>a-b\in F</m>. (Closed under subtraction) </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> For any <m>a,b\in F</m>, we have <m>a/b\in F</m>. (Closed under division) </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
    Then <m>F</m> is a field under the addition and multiplication in <m>K</m>. In particular, <m>F</m>
    is a subfield of <m>K</m>. </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  <proof>
      <p> We check all of the axioms in <xref ref="def_field" />. Since <m>F</m> is closed under
    subtraction, <m>1_K-1_K=0_K\in F</m>. Since <m>0_K\in F</m> and <m>F</m> is closed under
    subtraction, we have <m>-a=0_K-a\in F</m> for any <m>a\in F</m>. Thus <m>F</m> is closed under
    additive inverses. Since <m>F</m> is closed under additive inverses and subtraction we have <m>a+b
    = a-(-b)\in F</m> for any <m>a,b\in F</m>. Thus <m>F</m> is closed under addition. </p>
      <p> We now turn to the associativity and commutative properties. For any <m>a,b,c\in F</m> we
    know <m>a,b,c\in K</m>. Since addition in <m>K</m> is associative, we know <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m>.
    Thus addition in <m>F</m> is associative. We say it is <em>inherited</em> from <m>K</m>.
    Similarly addition in <m>F</m> is commutative, <m>0_K</m> is the additive identity,
    multiplication is associative and commutative, <m>1_K</m> is the multiplicative identity, and
    the distributive laws hold. </p>
      <p> Lastly, since <m>F</m> is closed under division and <m>1_K\in F</m>, for any <m>b\in F</m>
    we have <m>1_K/b\in F</m> and so the multiplicative inverse of <m>b</m> is in <m>F</m>. Thus <m>
    F</m> is closed under taking multiplicative inverses. This completes the checks of each of the
    10 axioms. </p>
    </proof>

  <p>
    We end this section with another interesting example of a field. We also illustrate how to use the Subfield Test.
  </p>
  
  <example xml:id="ex_qAdjoinNegative5">
    <title>Adjoining <m>\sqrt{-5}</m> to the Rationals</title>
    <statement>
      <p> 
        Define the set of rationals <em>adjoin</em> <m>\sqrt{-5}</m> by: <me>
        \Q(\sqrt{-5}) = \{a+b\sqrt{-5}\mid a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\}.
        </me> This is a subset of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>. We claim that <m>\Q(\sqrt{d})</m> is a <em>subfield</em> 
        of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        We apply the <xref ref="thm_subfieldTest" text="title"/>. In particular, <m>\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})\subset \C</m> and the latter is a field. We
        first show that <m>1+0i\in\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m> but this is just the element <m>1+0\sqrt{d}\in\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show closure under subtraction. Take <m>a+b\sqrt{-5},c+d\sqrt{-5}\in\Q</m>, then 
        <me>(a+b\sqrt{-5}) - (c+d\sqrt{-5}) = (a-c) + (b-d)\sqrt{-5}.</me>
        Since <m> (a-c),(b-d)\in \Q</m>, we conclude that <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m> is closed under subtraction.
      </p>
      <p> 
        We now show closure under division. Suppose <m>a+b\sqrt{-5},c+d\sqrt{-5}\in\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m>. Writing <m>c+d\sqrt{-5} = c+d\sqrt{5}i</m>, we know that 
        <me>(c+d\sqrt{5}i)^{-1} = \frac{c}{c^2+5d^2} + \frac{-d\sqrt{5}}{c^2+5d^2}i</me>
        which we can recombine the <m>i</m> and <m>\sqrt{5}</m>:
        <me>(c+d\sqrt{5}i)^{-1} = \frac{c}{c^2+5d^2} + \frac{-d}{c^2+5d^2}\sqrt{-5}.</me>
        Note that <m>c^2+5d^2=0</m> would say <m>(c/d)^2 = -5</m> which is absurd so the inverse is well-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we divide:
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp(a+b\sqrt{-5})\cdot (c+d\sqrt{-5})^{-1} </mrow>
          <mrow>=\amp(a+b\sqrt{-5})\cdot \left(\frac{c}{c^2+5d^2} + \frac{-d}{c^2+5d^2}\sqrt{-5} \right) </mrow>
          <mrow>=\amp \left(\frac{ac}{c^2+5d^2} + \frac{5bd}{c^2+5d^2}\right) + \left(\frac{-ad}{c^2+5d^2}+ \frac{bc}{c^2+5d^2}\right)\sqrt{-5}</mrow>
          <mrow>=\amp \frac{ac+5bd}{c^2+5d^2} + \frac{-ad+bc}{c^2+5d^2}\sqrt{-5}</mrow>
        </md>
        and since <m>\Q</m> is a field it is closed under arithmetic. In particular <m>\frac{ac+5bd}{c^2+5d^2}, \frac{-ad+bc}{c^2+5d^2}\in \Q</m>. 
        Thus <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m> is closed under division.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude, by the Subfield Test, that <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m> is a subfield of <m>\C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The reader should take note that the importance of using <m>-5</m> under the radical was only that <m>\sqrt{-5}\notin \Q</m>. In particular, 
    for any <m>d\in\Q</m> such that <m>\sqrt{d}\notin\Q</m> the proof will go through exactly the same. You will carry this out in Exercise????
