      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What multiplicative properties can we generalize from <m>\Z</m> to any integral domain?</li>
      <li>What are the differences between a prime and irreducible element in a commutative ring?</li>
    </ul>

<introduction>
  <p>
    When we introduced the notion of integral domain,
    we said that part of the reason for the definition was to capture some of the most essential properties of the integers. This is the heart of abstraction and generalization in mathematics: to distill the important properties of our objects of interest and explore the consequences of <em>those</em> properties.
    One such important property of <m>\Z</m> is <em>cancellation</em>.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_domainCancellationLaw">
    <title>Cancellation Law</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring. Then <m>R</m> is a domain if and only if for all <m>a,b,c\in R</m> with
        <m>c\ne 0</m> and <m>ac = bc</m>, we have <m>a = b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>R</m> is a domain and <m>ac = bc</m>.
      Then <m>ac - bc = 0</m>, so <m>(a-b)c = 0</m>.
      Since <m>R</m> is a domain, it has no zero divisors, and therefore 
      either <m>c = 0</m> or <m>a-b=0</m>.
      The first possibility cannot happen as <m>c\ne 0</m>. We therefore must have <m>a-b = 0</m>, or <m>a =b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, by contrapositive, assume that <m>R</m> is not a domain.
      Let <m>z\in R</m> be a zero divisor;
      then there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> such that <m>xz = 0 = 0 z</m>.
      Since <m>z\ne 0</m> as zero-divisors are non-zero, this implies that <m>x = 0</m> as we can cancel the <m>z</m>'s, a contradiction.
    </p>
  </proof>      

  <p>
    We may read <xref ref="thm_domainCancellationLaw" /> as saying that the defining property of an integral domain is the ability to
    cancel common nonzero factors. Note that we have not <em>divided</em>;
    division is not a binary operation, and nonzero elements of rings need not be units.
    However, as was the case in <m>\Z</m>, there are notions of <em>divisibility</em> and <em>factorization</em> in rings.

        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring, and let <m>a,b\in R</m>.
        We say <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
        <m>b</m> and write <m>a\mid b</m> if there is a <m>c\in R</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.

    <p>
      In <m>\Z/5</m>, every non-zero element is a unit. Thus any element <m>\bar{a}\in\Z/5</m> is a factor of <m>\bar{2}</m> as 
      <m>\bar{2} = \bar{a}(\bar{a}^{-1}\bar{2})</m>. This is a general property: units are always factors of every element.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\Z/6</m>, the factors of <m>\bar{2}</m> are <m>\bar{2}, \bar{4}</m> as <m>\bar{2} = \bar{4}\cdot\bar{2}</m>.

    Our definition of prime also extends nicely to commutative rings. Indeed, the desire to extend the familiar notion 
    of prime from <m>\Z</m> to any ring is the reason for our less-familiar definition given in <xref ref="def_primeInteger" />.

        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring. We say a nonzero nonunit element <m>a\in R</m> is <term>prime</term>

  <p>
    A notion related to primality is irreducibility. In fact, one might reasonably say that irreducibility is the 
    natural generalization of the typical definition of prime one encounters in school mathematics. However, we will see 
    that the notions differ in general.

        one of <m>b</m> or <m>c</m> is a unit.

    In domains, all primes are irreducible.
  </p>
  
  <theorem xml:id="thm_primesAreIrreducibleInDomains">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a domain. If <m>a\in R</m> is prime, then <m>a</m> is irreducible.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Compare to the proof of <xref ref="thm_euclidslemma">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>a\in R</m> be prime, and suppose that <m>a = bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>. We show 
      that either <m>b</m> or <m>c</m> is a unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>a=bc</m>, we have <m>a|bc</m>. By definition either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.
      Without loss of generality, assume <m>a|b</m>.
      Then there is a <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>ak=b</m>, so <m>a = (ak)c</m>,
      and we use the Cancellation Law to cancel <m>a</m> to obtain <m>1_R = kc</m>.
      Thus, <m>c</m> is a unit, making <m>a</m> irreducible.
    </p>
  </proof>
  
  <p>
    In familiar settings, the notion of prime and irreducible exactly coincide.
  </p>
  
  <theorem xml:id="thm_irreducibleIsPrimeInZ">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every irreducible in <m>\Z</m> is prime.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>p\in \Z</m> be irreducible, and suppose that <m>d|p</m>.
      Then <m>p = de</m>. Since <m>p</m> is irreducible, either <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is a unit.
      However, the only units are <m>\pm 1</m>, so either one of <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is <m>p</m> or <m>-p</m>.
      In either case, <m>p</m> is prime.
    </p>
  </proof>

    Despite their overlap in familiar settings, primes and irreducibles are distinct types of elements. As the next exploration demonstrates, 
    not all primes are irreducible. What is more, <xref ref="exer_irreducibleNotPrime" /> will show that not all 
    irreducibles are primes, even in domains!

    <em>Existence:</em> If <m>f(x) = 0</m>,

    If <m>f(x)\ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>,

      and so <m>\gcd(x^4-1,x^4+x) = -x-1</m>. But since greatest common divisors are only unique up to units, we say <m>\gcd(x^4-1,x^4+x) = x+1</m> by multiplying 
      through by <m>-1</m>.

<p>
  The previous example shows that in polynomials over a field we can always multiply through by an appropriate constant so that the greatest common divisor 
  is <em>monic</em>.
</p>

<definition>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x),g(x)\in F[x]</m> be polynomials over a field, not both zero. The greatest common divisor is the monic polynomial which is a greatest common 
      divisor of <m>f,g</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  Since greatest common divisors are all associates, once we require that they are monic the gcd becomes unique.
</p>

<lemma>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>d,d'</m> be two monic greatest common divisors of <m>f,g\in F[x]</m> where <m>F</m> is a field. Then <m>d=d'</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>d,d'</m> are both greatest common divisors, <m>d\mid d'</m> and <m>d'\mid d</m>. In particular, this only happens when <m>d = \lambda d'</m> for 
      some <m>\lambda\in F</m>. Since they are both monic, it must be that <m>\lambda=1</m>.

    <p>
      Consider the polynomials <m>x^4+2x^4-x^2+1</m> and <m>x^4-1</m>. We compute their gcd using repeated division:
      <md>
        <mrow> x^5+2x^4-x^2+1 \amp= (x+2)\cdot (x^4-1) +(-x^2+x+3)</mrow>

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Euclidean Algorithm tells us a greatest common divisor is <m>-51/49</m>. Multiplying by <m>-49/51</m> we have 
      <me>\gcd(x^4+2x^4-x^2+1,x^4-1) = 1.</me>
      In particular, these polynomials are relatively prime.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>F</m> be a field. For any polynomials <m>f,g\in F[x]</m> not both 0, there are polynomials <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> such that
      <me>
        pf + qg = \gcd(f,g)
      </me>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <proof>
    <p>
    The Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of <m>f,g</m>. After running the Euclidean Algorithm, we have a sequence of remainders and 
    quotients <m>r_i</m> and <m>q_i</m>, respectively. Here <m>r_{-2} = f</m> and <m>r_{-1} = g</m>:
    <md>
      <mrow>r_{-2} \amp= q_0r_{-1} + r_0 </mrow>
      <mrow>r_{-1} \amp = q_1r_0+r_1</mrow>
      <mrow>\vdots \amp= \vdots </mrow>
      <mrow>r_{n-3}\amp = q_{n-1}r_{n-2}+r_{n-1}</mrow>
      <mrow>r_{n-2}\amp = q_nr_{n-1}+r_n</mrow>
      <mrow>r_{n-1}\amp= q_{n+1}r_n+0</mrow>
    </md>
    where <m>r_n = \gcd(f,g)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving this system of equations for the remainders we get:
      <md>
      <mrow>r_{-2} -q_0r_{-1} \amp= r_0 </mrow>
      <mrow>r_{-1} - q_1r_0 \amp= r_1</mrow>
      <mrow>\vdots \amp= \vdots </mrow>
      <mrow>r_{n-3} - q_{n-1}r_{n-2} \amp= r_{n-1}</mrow>
      <mrow>r_{n-2} - q_nr_{n-1}\amp= r_n</mrow>
    </md>
    Now substitute <m>r_{n-1}</m> from the second to last equation into the last equation:
    <md>
      <mrow> r_n \amp= r_{n-2}-q_nr_{n-1}</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= r_{n-2}-q_n(r_{n-3}-q_{n-1}r_{n-2}) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp= (1+q_nq_{n-1})r_{n-2}-q_nr_{n-3}</mrow>
    </md>
    and in particular we have expressed <m>r_n</m> as a polynomial combination of <m>r_{n-2}</m> and <m>r_{n-3}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this equation substitute in <m>r_{n-2}</m>, which is a polynomial combination of <m>r_{n-3}</m> and <m>r_{n-4}</m>. 
      This will express <m>r_n</m> as a polynomial combination of <m>r_{n-3}</m> and <m>r_{n-4}</m>. And keep doing so until we have arrived at
      <me>
        \gcd(f,g) = r_n = pr_{-2}+qr_{-1} = pf+qg.
      </me>
      This completes the proof.
    </p>
  </proof>

<example>
  <title>B&#xe9;zout Coefficients over <m>\mathbb{F}_2</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let's consider the polynomials <m>f(x) = x^5+x^4+1</m> and <m>g(x) = x^3+x</m> as polynomials in <m>\mathbb{F}_2[x]</m>. Carrying out 
      repeated division:
      <md>
        <mrow>x^5+x^4+1 \amp= (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x)+(x^2+x+1) </mrow>
        <mrow>x^3+x \amp= (x+1)(x^2+x+1) + (x+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2+x+1 \amp = x\cdot (x+1)+1</mrow>
        <mrow>x+1 \amp = 1\cdot(x+1)+0</mrow>
      </md>
      and so <m>\gcd(f,g) = 1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find B&#xe9;out coefficients, we solve for the remainders:
      <md>
        <mrow>x^5+x^4+1 - (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x)\amp=(x^2+x+1) </mrow>
        <mrow>x^3+x - (x+1)(x^2+x+1) \amp= (x+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2+x+1 - x\cdot (x+1) \amp= 1</mrow>
      </md>
      and substitute <m>x+1</m> into the last equation:
      <md>
        <mrow> 1\amp= x^2+x+1-x(x^3+x-(x+1)(x^2+x+1)) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = (x^2+x+1)(x^2+x+1)+x(x^3+x)</mrow>
      </md>
      note that in <m>\mathbb{F}_2</m> we have <m>1=-1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now substitute <m>x^2+x+1</m> into this equation:
      <md>
        <mrow> 1\amp= (x^2+x+1)(x^2+x+1)+x(x^3+x) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp=(x^2+x+1)((x^5+x^4+1)-(x^2+x+1)(x^3+x)) + x(x^3+x) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp=(x^2+x+1)(x^5+x^4+1) + (x^4+x^2+x+1)(x^3+x) </mrow>
      </md>
      and we have found our B&#xe9;zout coefficients.
    </p>
  </statement>
</example>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let's use the same polynomials: <m>x^5+x^4+1</m> and <m>x^3+x</m> but work over <m>\mathbb{F}_3</m> instead.
      Carrying out repeated division yields:
      <md>
        <mrow>x^5+x^4+1 \amp= (x^2+x+2)(x^3+x) + (2x^2+x+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>x^3+x \amp= (2x+2)(2x^2+x+1) +1</mrow>
      </md>
      and we will stop here because we have a constant remainder. This means that in <m>\mathbb{F}_3</m> we have:
      <me>
        \gcd(x^5+x^4+1,x^3+x) = 1.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving our equations for the remainders yields:
      <md>
        <mrow>x^5+x^4+1 -(x^2+x+2)(x^3+x) = (2x^2+x+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>x^3+x -(2x+2)(2x^2+x+1) \amp= 1</mrow>
      </md>
      and so we substitute the first equation into the second:
      <md>
        <mrow>1 \amp= x^3+x -(2x+2)(2x^2+x+1) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= x^3+x-(2x+2)(x^5+x^4+1 -(x^2+x+2)(x^3+x)) </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (x+1)(x^5+x^4+1) + (2x^3+x^2+2)(x^3+x)</mrow>
      </md>
      noting that <m>-2=1</m> and <m>-1=2</m> in <m>\mathbb{F}_3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice here that the coefficients are different in degrees than the previous example.
