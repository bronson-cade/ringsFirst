      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What multiplicative properties can we generalize from <m>\Z</m> to any integral domain?</li>
      <li>What are the differences between a prime and irreducible element in a commutative ring?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
    
     
<introduction>
  <p>
    When we introduced the notion of integral domain,
    we said that part of the reason for the definition was to capture some of the most essential properties of the integers. This is the heart of abstraction and generalization in mathematics: to distill the important properties of our objects of interest and explore the consequences of <em>those</em> properties.
    One such important property of <m>\Z</m> is <em>cancellation</em>.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_domainCancellationLaw">
    <title>Cancellation Law</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring. Then <m>R</m> is a domain if and only if for all <m>a,b,c\in R</m> with
        <m>c\ne 0</m> and <m>ac = bc</m>, we have <m>a = b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>R</m> is a domain and <m>ac = bc</m>.
      Then <m>ac - bc = 0</m>, so <m>(a-b)c = 0</m>.
      Since <m>R</m> is a domain, it has no zero divisors, and therefore 
      either <m>c = 0</m> or <m>a-b=0</m>.
      The first possibility cannot happen as <m>c\ne 0</m>. We therefore must have <m>a-b = 0</m>, or <m>a =b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, by contrapositive, assume that <m>R</m> is not a domain.
      Let <m>z\in R</m> be a zero divisor;
      then there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> such that <m>xz = 0 = 0 z</m>.
      Since <m>z\ne 0</m> as zero-divisors are non-zero, this implies that <m>x = 0</m> as we can cancel the <m>z</m>'s, a contradiction.
    </p>
  </proof>      

  <p>
    We may read <xref ref="thm_domainCancellationLaw" /> as saying that the defining property of an integral domain is the ability to
    cancel common nonzero factors. Note that we have not <em>divided</em>;
    division is not a binary operation, and nonzero elements of rings need not be units.
    However, as was the case in <m>\Z</m>, there are notions of <em>divisibility</em> and <em>factorization</em> in rings.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity, and let <m>a,b\in R</m>.
        We say <m>a</m> <term>divides</term>
        <m>b</m> and write <m>a\mid b</m> if there is a <m>c\in R</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
        We then say that <m>a</m> is a <term>factor</term> of <m>b</m>.

  <solution>
    <p>
      In <m>\Z/5</m>, every non-zero element is a unit. Thus any element <m>\bar{a}\in\Z/5</m> is a factor of <m>\bar{2}</m> as 
      <m>\bar{2} = \bar{a}(\bar{a}^{-1}\bar{2})</m>. This is a general property: units are always factors of every element.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\Z/6</m>, the factors of <m>\bar{2}</m> are <m>\bar{2}, \bar{4}</m> as <m>\bar{2} = \bar{4}\cdot\bar{2}</m>.

  <p>
    Our definition of prime also extends nicely to commutative rings. Indeed, the desire to extend the familiar notion 
    of prime from <m>\Z</m> to any ring is the reason for our less-familiar definition given in <xref ref="def_primeInteger" />.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_primeElementsRings">
    <idx><h>prime (ring element)</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be commutative. We say a nonzero nonunit element <m>a\in R</m> is <term>prime</term>
        if whenever <m>a\mid bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>, either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    A notion related to primality is irreducibility. In fact, one might reasonably say that irreducibility is the 
    natural generalization of the typical definition of prime one encounters in school mathematics. However, we will see 
    that the notions differ in general.

        if whenever <m>a = bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>,
        one of <m>b</m> or <m>c</m> is a unit.

    In domains, all primes are irreducible.
  </p>
  
  <theorem xml:id="thm_primesAreIrreducibleInDomains">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a domain. If <m>a\in R</m> is prime, then <m>a</m> is irreducible.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Compare to the proof of <xref ref="thm_euclidslemma">Theorem</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>a\in R</m> be prime, and suppose that <m>a = bc</m> for some <m>b,c\in R</m>. We show 
      that either <m>b</m> or <m>c</m> is a unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>a=bc</m>, we have <m>a|bc</m>. By definition either <m>a|b</m> or <m>a|c</m>.
      Without loss of generality, assume <m>a|b</m>.
      Then there is a <m>k\in R</m> such that <m>ak=b</m>, so <m>a = (ak)c</m>,
      and we use the Cancellation Law to cancel <m>a</m> to obtain <m>1_R = kc</m>.
      Thus, <m>c</m> is a unit, making <m>a</m> irreducible.
    </p>
  </proof>
  
  <p>
    In familiar settings, the notion of prime and irreducible exactly coincide.
  </p>
  
  <theorem xml:id="thm_irreducibleIsPrimeInZ">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every irreducible in <m>\Z</m> is prime.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>p\in \Z</m> be irreducible, and suppose that <m>d|p</m>.
      Then <m>p = de</m>. Since <m>p</m> is irreducible, either <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is a unit.
      However, the only units are <m>\pm 1</m>, so either one of <m>d</m> or <m>e</m> is <m>p</m> or <m>-p</m>.
      In either case, <m>p</m> is prime.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Despite their overlap in familiar settings, primes and irreducibles are distinct types of elements. As the next exploration demonstrates, 
    not all primes are irreducible. What is more, <xref ref="exer_irreducibleNotPrime" /> will show that not all 
    irreducibles are primes, even in domains!

    Our last straightforward generalization from the multiplicative structure of <m>\Z</m> is the notion of greatest common divisor.

            Define a <term>norm</term> on <m>R</m>, i.e. <m>N\colon R\to\mathbb{Z}</m> by 
            <me>
              N(a+b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2+5b^2.
            </me>
          </p>
          Prove that <m>N</m> is multiplicative, i.e. <m>N( (a+b\sqrt{-5})(c+d\sqrt{-5})) = N(a+b\sqrt{-5})N(c+d\sqrt{-5})</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Verify that in <m>R</m> we have the equality <m>2\cdot 3 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the norm <m>N</m> to prove that <m>2</m> does not divide <m>1+\sqrt{-5}</m> nor does it divide <m>1-\sqrt{-5}</m>.
            In particular, this tells us <m>2</m> is not a prime element.

        <li>
          <p>
            Use the norm to prove that <m>2</m> is irreducible.
