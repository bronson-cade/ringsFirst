      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
  </introduction>
    <ul>
        <li>What are rings and how do they relate to fields?</li>
        <li>What are subrings, and how can we tell if a given subset of a ring is a subring?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
    
  <introduction>
  <p>
    In the previous section, we observed that many familiar number systems are fields but that some are not.
    As we will see, these non-fields are often more structurally interesting, at least from the perspective of factorization. 
    In this section, we explore them in more detail. We start that exploration with a rigorous definition of polynomials and their arithmetic operations.

    <title>Integral Polynomials</title>
  <definition xml:id="def_polynomial">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>polynomial in <m>x</m> with coefficients in <m>\Z</m></term>
        is an expression of the form
        <me>
          p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n
        </me>,
        where <m>a_0,a_1,a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\Z</m> and <m>a_n\ne 0</m>. We will sometimes omit the function notation and denote 
        <m>p(x)</m> simply by <m>p</m>.

        We call <m>n\in \N_0</m> the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial <m>p</m>, denoted <m>\deg(p) = n</m>, and
        <m>a_0,a_1,\ldots,
        a_n</m> the <term>coefficients</term> of the polynomial.
        The coefficient <m>a_n</m> is known as the
        <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>p</m>,
        and <m>a_n x^n</m> is the <term>leading term</term> of <m>p</m>.

        The set of all integral polynomials is:
        <me>
          \Z[x] := \{a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x + \cdots + a_n x^n\mid n\in \N_0, \ a_i\in \mathbb{Z}\}.
        </me>
        Lastly, two polynomials are <em>equal</em> if and only if they have the same coefficients.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We know from our experience with polynomials in calculus and other courses that when we add two polynomials 
    we again get a polynomial. Also when we multiply two polynomials we again get a polynomial. However, in order 
    to show that addition and multiplication are well-defined operations on <m>\Z[x]</m>, they must first be defined! 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is easier said than done. Let's remind ourselves with an example that addition of polynomials is <em>combine like terms</em>. 
    For example:
    <me>
      (2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 + (-2)x+1.
    </me>
    Let's do this computation slightly differently:
    <md>
      <mrow>\amp (2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp (0x^3+2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x+0)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp (0+3)x^3+(2+2)x^2+(-3+1)x + (1+0)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp 3x^3+4x^2+(-2)x + 1.</mrow>
    </md>
    Notice, that to properly combine like terms we need to artificially add 0's. This is a mental trick we tacitly do when we compute anyways 
    but this idea of extending a polynomial by 0 is crucial to defining the addition and multiplication operations.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <title>Alternatives to Extension by 0</title>
    <p>
      An alternative (more rigorous) way of defining addition and multiplication is to not use the variable <m>x</m> at all. 
      But rather to think of polynomials as defined by their coefficients. In this case, we define a polynomial as a list of integers (indexed by <m>\N_0</m>): 
      <m>(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)</m> such that only finitely many of the entries are non-zero. Or equivalently, that there exists <m>N\in\N_0</m> such that <m>a_n=0</m> for all <m>n\ge N</m>.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <definition xml:id="def_polynomialAddition">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given two polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we define their sum <m>p(x)+q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> as follows. Write 
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x)\amp= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m.</mrow>
      </md>
      If <m>n\geq m</m>, we extend <m>q(x)</m> by 0:
      <me>
        q(x) = b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m + b_{m+1}x^{m+1}+\cdots + b_nx^n
      </me>
      where <m>b_{m+1}=\cdots = b_n = 0</m>. If <m>m\geq n</m>, we extend <m>p(x)</m> by 0:
      <me>
        p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n + a_{n+1}x^{n+1}+\cdots + a_mx^m,
      </me>
      where <m>a_{n+1} = \cdots = a_m = 0</m>. Then 
      <me>
        p(x)+q(x) = (a_0+b_0) + (a_1+b_1)x + (a_2+b_2)x^2 + \cdots + (a_n+b_n)x^n.
      </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The extra effort we've put in to defining polynomial addition will simplify proofs as the following proposition shows.
  </p>

  <proposition xml:id="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Addition of integral polynomials is commutative. That is, for any <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we have

    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>. Possibly by extending by 0, we can assume
      <md>

        <mrow>q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_nx^n.</mrow>
      </md>
      Then 
      <md>

        <mrow> \amp = q(x)+p(x)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Notice that in the proof of <xref ref="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative" /> we did not need to go into 
    cases based off of if the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is greater than or less than the degree of <m>q(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Mimic the proof of <xref ref="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative" /> to prove that addition of integral polynomials is associative.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    We now handle polynomial multiplication. We first recall how polynomial multiplication works with the goal of writing a definition down.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the integral polynomials <m>p(x) = 1+x+2x^2+3x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 3+2x+x^2</m>. Let's compute their product 
        using distribution:
        <md>
          <mrow> p(x)\cdot q(x)\amp=(1+x+2x^2+3x^3)\cdot(3+2x+x^2) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= 3+2x+x^2 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp+ 3x+2x^2+x^3 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp+ 6x^2+4x^3+2x^4 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp+ 9x^3+6x^4+3x^5 </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=3+5x+7x^2+14x^3+8x^4+3x^5 </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    In particular, to compute the produce we needed to be able to: compute all pairwise products between terms of <m>p(x)</m> and terms of <m>q(x)</m> 
    and then combine like terms. The following definition will be a formalization of this and in particular is somewhat involved due to the nature 
    of poynomial multiplication.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_polynomialMultiplication">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given two polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we define their sum <m>p(x)+q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> as follows. Write 
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x)\amp= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m.</mrow>
      </md>
      Extend both <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> by <m>0</m> so that:
      <me>
        p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n + a_{n+1}x^{n+1}+\cdots + a_{n+m}x^{n+m},
      </me>
      where <m>a_{n+1} = \cdots = a_{n+m} = 0</m>. Then 
      <me>
        q(x) = b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m + b_{m+1}x^{m+1}+\cdots + b_{m+n}x^{m+n}
      </me>
      where <m>b_{m+1}=\cdots = b_{m+n} = 0</m> and 

      <me>
        p(x)\cdot q(x) = c_0+c_1x+\cdots +c_ix^i+\cdots + c_{m+n}x^{n+m}
      </me>
      where 
      <md>
        <mrow>c_i \amp= \sum_{k=0}^ia_kb_{i-k}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= a_0b_i + a_1b_{i-1}+\cdots + a_{i-1}b_1 + a_ib_0.</mrow>
      </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    As was the case with polynomial addition, this definition is aimed to make proving 
    statements about polynomial muliplication easier. 
  </p>

  <proposition xml:id="prop_polynomialMultiplicationIsCommutative">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Multplication of integral polynomials is commutative. That is, for any <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we have 
        <m>p(x)\cdot q(x) = q(x)\cdot p(x)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Take <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> of degrees <m>m,n</m>, respectively. Extend both by zero so that 
        <md>
          <mrow>p(x) \amp= a_0+a_1x+\cdots +a_{m+n}x^{m+n} </mrow>
          <mrow>q(x) \amp= b_0+b_1x+\cdots +b_{m+n}x^{m+n} </mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>a_{m+1} = \cdots = a_{m+n} = 0</m> and <m>b_{n+1} = \cdots = b_{m+n} = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then 
        <me> p(x)\cdot q(x) = c_0+c_1x+\cdots + c_{m+n}x^{m+n} </me>
        where 
        <me>c_i = a_0b_i+a_1b_{i-1}+\cdots + a_{i-1}b_1+a_ib_0.</me>
        We also have 
        <me>q(x)\cdot p(x) = d_0 + d_1x + \cdots + d_{m+n}x^{m+n}</me>
        where 
        <me>d_i = b_0a_i + b_1a_{i-1}+\cdots + b_{i-1}a_1+b_ia_0.</me>
        We need to show <m>c_i=d_i</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end, recall that addition in <m>\Z</m> is commutative and multiplication is commutative too:
        <md>
          <mrow> c_i \amp= a_0b_i+a_1b_{i-1}+\cdots + a_{i-1}b_1+a_ib_0 </mrow>

          <mrow> \amp= b_0a_i + b_1a_{i-1}+\cdots + b_{i-1}a_1+b_ia_0</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= d_i </mrow>
        </md>
        Since the coefficients of <m>p(x)\cdot q(x)</m> and <m>q(x)\cdot p(x)</m> agreee they are equal polynomials.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>

  <p>
    The preceeding proof was necessarily long and somewhat complicated because polynomial multiplication is long and complicated. 
    It's also worth noting that we very much relied on arithmetic properties of <m>\Z</m>, particular commutative multiplication.
  </p>

  <p>
    We leave our discussion of integral polynomials to introduce the main course: <em>rings</em>. We will then return to them as important examples or rings.

    In the 1920s, Emmy Noether was the first to explicitly describe the ring axioms as we know them today,
    and her definition of a (not-necessarily-commutative) ring has led to a great deal of interesting work in algebra,
    number theory, and geometry, including the
    (see <xref ref="Sec-Nonunique-Factorization" />
    for more on the historical development of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem).
    Most modern definitions of <em>ring</em>
    agree with our <xref ref="def_ring">Definition</xref>
    and allow for rings with noncommutative multiplication.

    The following theorem states that the set of polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is itself a ring under the usual 
    operations of polynomial addition of like terms, and multiplication via distribution.
    The proof is not tricky, but a rigorous justification (especially of, e.g., the associativity of polynomial multiplication)
    is tedious, and thus is omitted.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_polynomialsFormRing">
  <title>Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>R</m> is a (commutative) ring, then <m>R[x]</m> is a (commutative) ring.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      As in the proof of <xref ref="prop_polynomialMultiplicationIsCommutative"/>, we see that if <m>R[x]</m> is a ring and <m>R</m> is commutative, then 
      <m>R[x]</m> must also be commutative. The proof carries over <em>mutatis mutandis</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see that <m>R[x]</m> is a ring, we need to check all eight axioms. Before we do that, recall in <xref ref="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative"/> 
      that we have already seen polynomial addition is commutative provided the addition of coefficients is commutative. That proof therefore carries over 
      <em>mutatis mutandis</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We check associativity. Take <m>p(x),q(x),r(x)\in R[x]</m> and, by extending by 0, we can assume 
      <md>
        <mrow> p(x)\amp= a_0+a_1x+\cdots +a_nx^n </mrow>
        <mrow> q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+\cdots +b_nx^n </mrow>
        <mrow> r(x)\amp= c_0+r_1x+\cdots +r_nx^n </mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>a_i,b_i,c_i\in R</m> for <m>i=0,\ldots,n</m>. Then the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in <m>p(x)+(q(x)+r(x))</m> 
      is <m>a_i+(b_i+c_i)</m>. The coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in <m>(p(x)+q(x)) + r(x)</m> is <m> (a_i+b_i)+c_i</m>. 
      Since <m>R</m> is a ring and addition is associative in <m>R</m> we have <m>a_i+(b_i+c_i) = (a_i+b_i) + c_i</m>. Since 
      the coefficients of <m>p(x)+(q(x)+r(x))</m> and <m>(p(x)+q(x)) + r(x)</m> are equal, they are equal polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      We claim <m>z(x) = 0_R</m> is the additive identity. Take <m>p(x)\in R[x]</m> and write 
      <me>p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\cdots +a_nx^n.</me>
      Then extend <m>z(x)</m> by zero:
      <me>z(x) = 0_R + 0_Rx+\cdots + 0_Rx^n.</me>
      The sum is then:
      <md>
        <mrow> z(x)+p(x)\amp= (0_R+a_0) + (0_R+a_1)x+\cdots + (0_R+a_n)x^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= a_0 + a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= p(x) </mrow>
      </md>
      as <m>0_R</m> is the additive identity in <m>R</m> so that <m>0_R+a_i = a_i</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
      Similarly, <m>p(x) + z(x) = p(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For additive inverses, suppose <m>p(x)</m> is as before. Then define <m>-p(x)\in R[x]</m> by:
      <m>-p(x) = (-a_0) + (-a_1)x + \cdots + (-a_n)x^n</m>
      where <m>-a_i</m> is the additive inverse of the coefficient <m>a_i</m> in <m>p(x)</m>. Then 
      <md>
        <mrow> \amp p(x)+(-p)(x)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (a_0+(-a_0)) + (a_1+(-a_1))x + \cdots + (a_n+(-a_n))x^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 0_R + 0_Rx + \cdots + 0_Rx^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= z(x) </mrow>
      </md>
      Similarly <m>(-p)(x)+p(x) = z(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proof that multiplication is associative is particularly notationally dense and we leave it as an exercise.
      For the multiplicative identity, set <m>i(x) = 1_R</m>. Take a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> as before. We extend <m>i(x)</m> 
      by zero via:
      <me>
        i(x) = b_0+\cdots +b_nx^n
      </me>
      where <m>b_0=1_R</m> and <m>b_i=0_R</m> for <m>i>0</m>. Then the product
      <me>
        p(x)\cdot i(x)= c_0+c_1x+\cdots +c_nx^n
      </me>
      where
      <me>
        c_i = a_0b_i+\cdots + a_ib_0.
      </me>
      However, <m>b_j=0</m> for <m>j>0</m> so for <m>k\neq i</m> we have <m>a_kb_{i-k}=0_R</m> by Exercise???? In particular, <m>c_i = a_ib_0 = a_i\cdot 1_R = a_i</m>.
      Since the coefficients of <m>p(x)\cdot i(x)</m> and <m>p(x)</m> are equal, the polynomials are equal: <m>p(x)\cdot i(x) = p(x)</m>. 
      Similarly <m>i(x)\cdot p(x)= p(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining two proofs are left- and right-distributive properties. As they are similar, we only prove the left-distributive property. TBD.
    </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>
<p>
  The preceeding theorem says that whenever we have a ring, polynomials with coefficients in that ring again form a ring. In particular, if <m>R</m> is a ring, then 
  so is <m>R[x]</m>, and hence so is <m>(R[x])[y]</m> and so on. This leads us to the corollary:
</p>
<corollary xml:id="cor_multivariatePolynomialRingIsARing">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>R</m> be a (commutative) ring and <m>x_1,\ldots,x_n</m> be indeterminates. Then the set of 
      polynomials in <m>x_1,\ldots,x_n</m> with coefficients in <m>R</m>, <m>R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]</m>, is a (commutative) ring.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We proceed by induction. The base case is <m>n=1</m>. This is the content of <xref ref="thm_polynomialsFormRing"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the inductive step, suppose <m>R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]</m> is a (commutative) ring. By <xref ref="thm_polynomialsFormRing"/>, 
      <m>R[x_1,\ldots,x_n][x_{n+1}]</m> is again a (commutative) ring. But the latter is the <m>R[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]</m>.

<p>
  We now have some great examples of commutative rings. Namely polynomial rings in some number of variables over any of <m>\Z,\Q,\R,</m> or <m>\C</m>. 
  As we have yet to see an example of a non-commutative ring we remedy this now.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex_M2R">
  <title>Square Matrices</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the set <m>M_2(\R)</m> of square <m>2\times 2</m> matrices over <m>\R</m> (or whatever ring or field you like to work with). 
      We recall matrix addition and multiplication:
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix}a_1 \amp b_1 \\ c_1 \amp d_1 \end{bmatrix} 
        + \begin{bmatrix}a_2 \amp b_2 \\ c_2 \amp d_2 \end{bmatrix}
        = \begin{bmatrix}(a_1+a_2) \amp (b_1+b_2) \\ (c_1+c_2) \amp (d_1+d_2) \end{bmatrix}
      </me>
      and 
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix}a_1 \amp b_1 \\ c_1 \amp d_1 \end{bmatrix} 
        \cdot \begin{bmatrix}a_2 \amp b_2 \\ c_2 \amp d_2 \end{bmatrix}
        = \begin{bmatrix} a_1a_2+b_1c_2 \amp a_1b_2+b_1d_2 \\ c_1a_2+d_1c_2 \amp c_1b_2+d_1d_2 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Exercise???? you will check this is a ring. We show that multiplication is not commutative. To that end, consider:
      <me>
        A=\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp 1 \\ 1 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix},
        B =\begin{bmatrix}0 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}.
      </me>
      Then 
      <me>
        A\cdot B = \begin{bmatrix}0 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 1 \end{bmatrix},
        B\cdot A = \begin{bmatrix}1 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}.
      </me>
      In particular, <m>A\cdot B\ne B\cdot A</m> and so matrix multiplication is not commutative.
    </p>
  </statement>
</example>

<p>
  In the previous example, we observed that matrix multiplication failed to be commutative for matrices with real entries. What about 
  for entries in a general ring? If you review that example, you will notice the only reason the products did not agree is because <m>0\ne 1</m> in <m>\R</m>.
  The next example shows that the multiplicative identity and additive identity sometimes agree.
</p>

<example>
  <title>The Zero Ring</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>R=\{0\}</m>. That is, a set with one element. Define addition and multiplication by 
      <m>0+0 = 0</m> and <m>0\cdot 0 = 0</m>. We claim that addition and multiplication define a ring structure 
      on <m>R</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all of the checks are straightforward. For example, to check associativity of addition we 
      only have one element so we just check <m>0+(0+0) = (0+0)+0</m>. But there is only one thing both sides can be: <m>0</m>. 
      So addition is associative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only property that warrants inspection is the multiplicative identity. We claim that in this ring <m>1_R = 0</m>. Indeed, 
      we need to show that for every <m>r\in R = \{0\}</m> that <m>0\cdot r= r</m>. But there's only element to check this on: <m>r=0</m> where it is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conclude that the zero ring is a ring!

        Then <m>S</m> is a subring if and only if:

              <m>S</m> is closed under subtraction.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>1_R\in S</m> and <m>S</m> is closed under multiplication and subtraction. We check each of the axioms in <xref ref="def_ring"/>. 
        Since <m>1_R\in S</m> and <m>S</m> is closed under subtraction we have <m>0_R = 1_R-1_R\in S</m>. For any <m>a\in S</m>, we know that <m>a\in R</m> so that 
        <me>
          a+0_R = 0_R+a=a\text{ and }a\cdot 1_R = 1_R\cdot a = a.
        </me>
        Thus <m>0_R</m> and <m>1_R</m> are the additive and multiplicative identities, respectively, in <m>S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any <m>b\in S</m>, we know that <m>-b=0_R-b\in S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is closed under additive inverses. If <m>a,b\in S</m>, then <m>a+b=a-(-b)\in S</m> so that <m>S</m> is closed under addition.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any triple of elements <m>a,b,c\in S</m>, we know <m>a,b,c\in R</m> so that <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m> and <m>a+b=b+a</m>. Thus associativity and commutativity of addition are inherited from <m>R</m>. 
        Similarly, <m>a\cdot(b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c</m>, <m>a\cdot(b+c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c</m>, and <m>(a+b)\cdot c = a\cdot c + b\cdot c</m>. That is, <m>S</m> inherits associativity of multiplication as well as the left- and right-distributive properties from <m>R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>S</m> is a ring under the multiplication and addition from <m>R</m>.

    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="ex_qAdjoinNegative5"/>, we saw that <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m> was a field and so it is a commutative ring. 
        Let's define a subset of this field by taking 
        those elements with integral real and imaginary part:
        <me>
          \Z[\sqrt{-5}] = \{a+b\sqrt{-5}\mid a,b\in\Z\}.
        </me>
        We claim that <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> is a subring of <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m>. To that end we apply the subring test. That is,
        <m>1_{\Q(\sqrt{-5})}\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>, it is closed under subtraction and multiplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see that <m>1+0\sqrt{-5}\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and so our subset has the multiplicative identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For closure under subtraction, take <m>a+b\sqrt{-5}, c+d\sqrt{-5}\in\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m>. Then 
        <me>
          (a+b\sqrt{-5})-(c+d\sqrt{-5}) = (a-c) + (b-d)\sqrt{-5}
        </me>
        and <m>a-c,b-d\in\Z</m>. We conclude <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> is closed under subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        For closure under multiplication we compute:
        <me>
          (a+b\sqrt{-5})\cdot (c+d\sqrt{-5}) = (ac+5bd) + (ad+bc)\sqrt{-5}
        </me>
        and again <m>ac+5bd,ad+bc\in\Z</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By the <xref ref="thm_subringTest" text="title"/>, we conclude <m>\Z[\sqrt{-5}]</m> is a subring of <m>\Q(\sqrt{-5})</m>. In particular, 
        it is a ring.

      </p>
    </statement>
  </exploration>
  <p>
    In other words, a unit in a ring is a nonzero element with a multiplicative inverse.
    The existence of units is the primary difference between fields and commutative rings: in a field, all nonzero elements are units, while in a commutative ring, no nonzero elements need be units, as <xref ref="thm-cri-field" /> demonstrates.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We describe the units in <m>\Z[x]</m>. Notice that for <m>p(x)q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, of degrees <m>m,n</m> respectively, 
        the leading coefficient of <m>p(x)\cdot q(x)</m> is
        <me>c_{m+n} = a_0b_{m+n} +a_1b_{m+n-1}+\dots + a_nb_m.</me>
        But <m>a_i = 0</m> for <m>i\ge </m> and <m>b_j=0</m> for <m>j\ge n</m>. Using this observation, we can conclude that <m>c_{m+n}=a_mb_n</m>, 
        see Exercise???? Since <m>a_m,b_n\ne 0</m> and the product of two non-zero integers remains non-zero, we conclude that <m>c_{m+n}\ne 0</m>. 
        In particular, 
        <me>
          \deg(p\cdot q) = \deg(p)+\deg(q).
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose that <m>p\cdot q = 1</m> in <m>\Z[x]</m>. Then 
        <md>
          <mrow> 0\amp=\deg(1) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=\deg(p\cdot q) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=\deg(p) + \deg(q). </mrow>
        </md>
        Since <m>\deg(p),\deg(q)\geq 0</m>, the only way this can happen is if <m>\deg(p) = \deg(q) = 0</m> so that <m>p,q</m> are constant polynomials. 
        Thus <m>p,q</m> are units in <m>\Z</m>. We conclude
        <me>
          \Z[x]^\times = \Z^\times = \{\pm 1\}.
