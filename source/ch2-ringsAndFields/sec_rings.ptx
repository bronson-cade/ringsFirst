  <introduction>
	<p>
      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
  </introduction>
    <ul>
        <li>What are rings and how do they relate to fields?</li>
        <li>What are subrings, and how can we tell if a given subset of a ring is a subring?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
    
  <introduction>
  <p>
    In the previous section, we observed that many familiar number systems are fields but that some are not.
    As we will see, these non-fields are often more structurally interesting, at least from the perspective of factorization. 
    In this section, we explore them in more detail. We start that exploration with a rigorous definition of polynomials and their arithmetic operations.

    <title>Integral Polynomials</title>
  <definition xml:id="def_polynomial">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>polynomial in <m>x</m> with coefficients in <m>\Z</m></term>
        is an expression of the form
        <me>
          p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n
        </me>,
        where <m>a_0,a_1,a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\Z</m> and <m>a_n\ne 0</m>. We will sometimes omit the function notation and denote 
        <m>p(x)</m> simply by <m>p</m>.

        We call <m>n\in \N_0</m> the <term>degree</term> of the polynomial <m>p</m>, denoted <m>\deg(p) = n</m>, and
        <m>a_0,a_1,\ldots,
        a_n</m> the <term>coefficients</term> of the polynomial.
        The coefficient <m>a_n</m> is known as the
        <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>p</m>,
        and <m>a_n x^n</m> is the <term>leading term</term> of <m>p</m>.

        The set of all integral polynomials is:
        <me>
          \Z[x] := \{a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x + \cdots + a_n x^n\mid n\in \N_0, \ a_i\in \mathbb{Z}\}.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We know from our experience with polynomials in calculus and other courses that when we add two polynomials 
    we again get a polynomial. Also when we multiply two polynomials we again get a polynomial. However, in order 
    to show that addition and multiplication are well-defined operations on <m>\Z[x]</m>, they must first be defined! 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is easier said than done. Let's remind ourselves with an example that addition of polynomials is <em>combine like terms</em>. 
    For example:
    <me>
      (2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 + (-2)x+1.
    </me>
    Let's do this computation slightly differently:
    <md>
      <mrow>\amp (2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp (0x^3+2x^2+(-3)x + 1) + (3x^3 + 2x^2 + x+0)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp (0+3)x^3+(2+2)x^2+(-3+1)x + (1+0)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp 3x^3+4x^2+(-2)x + 1.</mrow>
    </md>
    Notice, that to properly combine like terms we need to artificially add 0's. This is a mental trick we tacitly do when we compute anyways 
    but this idea of extending a polynomial by 0 is crucial to defining the addition and multiplication operations.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <title>Alternatives to Extension by 0</title>
    <p>
      An alternative (more rigorous) way of defining addition and multiplication is to not use the variable <m>x</m> at all. 
      But rather to think of polynomials as defined by their coefficients. In this case, we define a polynomial as a list of integers (indexed by <m>\N_0</m>): 
      <m>(a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots)</m> such that only finitely many of the entries are non-zero. Or equivalently, that there exists <m>N\in\N_0</m> such that <m>a_n=0</m> for all <m>n\ge N</m>.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <definition xml:id="def_polynomialAddition">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given two polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we define their sum <m>p(x)+q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> as follows. Write 
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x)\amp= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m.</mrow>
      </md>
      If <m>n\geq m</m>, we extend <m>q(x)</m> by 0:
      <me>
        q(x) = b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_mx^m + b_{m+1}x^{m+1}+\cdots + b_nx^n
      </me>
      where <m>b_{m+1}=\cdots = b_n = 0</m>. If <m>m\geq n</m>, we extend <m>p(x)</m> by 0:
      <me>
        p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n + a_{n+1}x^{n+1}+\cdots + a_mx^m,
      </me>
      where <m>a_{n+1} = \cdots = a_m = 0</m>. Then 
      <me>
        p(x)+q(x) = (a_0+b_0) + (a_1+b_1)x + (a_2+b_2)x^2 + \cdots + (a_n+b_n)x^n.
      </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The extra effort we've put in to defining polynomial addition will simplify proofs as the following proposition shows.
  </p>

  <proposition xml:id="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Addition of integral polynomials is commutative. That is, for any <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>, we have 
        <me>p(x)+q(x) = q(x)+p(x).</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m>. Possibly by extending by 0, we can assume
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x)\amp= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_nx^n.</mrow>
      </md>
      Then 
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x)+q(x)\amp= (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n) + (b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_nx^n)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+(a_2+b_2)x^2+\cdots + (a_n+b_n)x^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (b_0+a_0)+(b_1+a_1)x+(b_2+a_2)x^2+\cdots + (b_n+a_n)x^n </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= (b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots + b_nx^n) + (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_nx^n)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = q(x)+p(x)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Notice that in the proof of <xref ref="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative" /> we did not need to go into 
    cases based off of if the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is greater than or less than the degree of <m>q(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Mimic the proof of <xref ref="prop_polynomialAdditionIsCommutative" /> to prove that addition of integral polynomials is associative.

    number theory, and geometry, including the

    The following theorem states that the set of polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> is itself a ring under the usual operations of polynomial addition of like terms,
    and multiplication via distribution.
    The proof is not tricky, but a rigorous justification
    (especially of, e.g., the associativity of polynomial multiplication)
    is tedious, and thus is omitted.

        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>1_R\in S</m> and <m>S</m> is closed under multiplication and subtraction. We check each of the axioms in <xref ref="def_ring"/>. 
        Since <m>1_R\in S</m> and <m>S</m> is closed under subtraction we have <m>0_R = 1_R-1_R\in S</m>. For any <m>a\in S</m>, we know that <m>a\in R</m> so that 
        <me>
          a+0_R = 0_R+a=a\text{ and }a\cdot 1_R = 1_R\cdot a = a.
        </me>
        Thus <m>0_R</m> and <m>1_R</m> are the additive and multiplicative identities, respectively, in <m>S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any <m>b\in S</m>, we know that <m>-b=0_R-b\in S</m>. Thus <m>S</m> is closed under additive inverses. If <m>a,b\in S</m>, then <m>a+b=a-(-b)\in S</m> so that <m>S</m> is closed under addition.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any triple of elements <m>a,b,c\in S</m>, we know <m>a,b,c\in R</m> so that <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m> and <m>a+b=b+a</m>. Thus associativity and commutativity of addition are inherited from <m>R</m>. 
        Similarly, <m>a\cdot(b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c</m>, <m>a\cdot(b+c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c</m>, and <m>(a+b)\cdot c = a\cdot c + b\cdot c</m>. That is, <m>S</m> inherits associativity of multiplication as well as the left- and right-distributive properties from <m>R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>S</m> is a ring under the multiplication and addition from <m>R</m>.

    In other words, a unit in a ring is a nonzero element with a multiplicative inverse.
    The existence of units is the primary difference between fields and commutative rings: in a field, all nonzero elements are units, while in a commutative ring, no nonzero elements need be units, as <xref ref="thm-cri-field" /> demonstrates.

  <theorem xml:id="thm-cri-field">

        A commutative ring <m>R</m> in which every nonzero element is a unit is a field.

  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Compare the axioms for a commutative ring and a field.
      The only thing missing from the ring axioms is the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
