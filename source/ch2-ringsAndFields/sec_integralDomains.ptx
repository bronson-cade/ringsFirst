    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and let <m>u\in R</m> be nonzero.
        If there is a <m>v\in R</m> such that <m>uv = vu = 1</m>,
        we say <m>u</m> is <term>unit</term> of <m>R</m>.
        We denote the set of units of <m>R</m> by <m>R^\times</m>.
        We say <m>x,y\in R</m> are <term>associates</term>
        if there exists some <m>u\in R^\times</m> such that <m>x = uy</m>.

      </p>
    </statement>
  </exploration>
  <p>
    In other words, a unit in a ring is a nonzero element with a multiplicative inverse.
    The existence of units is the primary difference between fields and commutative rings with identity: in a field, all nonzero elements are units, while in a commutative ring with identity, no nonzero elements need be units, as <xref ref="thm-cri-field" /> demonstrates.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm-cri-field">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A commutative ring with identity <m>R</m> in which every nonzero element is a unit is a field.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Compare the axioms for a commutative ring with identity and a field.
      The only thing missing from the ring axioms is the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.
    </p>
  </proof>
  

  <p>
    One of the interesting side effects of our definition of <em>ring</em>
    is that it allows for behavior that may at first appear unintuitive or downright weird.
  </p>
  <definition>
  <idx>zero divisor</idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>zero divisor</term> in a ring <m>R</m> is a nonzero element <m>z\in R</m> such that there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> with <m>zx = 0</m> or <m>xz=0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Notice that the reason the idea of zero divisors at first appears weird is that they are not something we encounter when working with our familiar sets of numbers, such as <m>\Z</m> or <m>\R</m>.
    In fact, we specifically use the fact that there are no zero divisors in our familiar numbers systems to solve equations in high school algebra (e.g., if <m>(x-2)(x+5)=0</m>,
    then <m>x-2=0</m> or <m>x+5=0</m>).
    The lack of zero divisors is one of the properties that does not persist in our abstraction from the integers to rings in general.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and suppose
        <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor.
        Then either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is a zero divisor.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor.
      Then <m>a,b\ne 0</m>
      (else <m>ab = 0</m>).
      Since <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor,
      there is some <m>c\ne 0</m> such that <m>(ab) c = 0</m>.
      If <m>bc\ne 0</m>,
      then <m>a</m> is a zero divisor, as <m>a(bc) = 0</m>.
      On the other hand, if <m>bc=0</m>,
      then <m>b</m> is a zero divisor, as <m>b,c\ne 0</m>.

  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>u\in R^\times</m> and suppose <m>u</m> is a zero divisor.
      Then there is some <m>v\ne 0</m> such that <m>uv = 0</m>.

        Answers may vary, but how about this: Let <m>\overline{a},\overline{b},\overline{c}\in \Z_m</m> such that <m>\overline{a}\cdot \overline{c} = \overline{b}\cdot \overline{c}</m>.

    Moreover, while both commutative and non-commutative rings with identity and zero divisors are of interest to mathematicians,
    we will focus our study on rings with no zero divisors.
    As these rings share many
    properties of the integers, they are known as <term>integral domains</term>.

        Every field is a domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>F</m> is a field, the nonzero elements of <m>F</m> are units,
      which cannot be zero divisors.
      Thus, <m>F</m> has no zero divisors.

  <theorem>

      <p>
        Let <m>m > 1</m> and <m>R = \Z_m</m>.

      The forward direction holds by <xref ref="theorem_everyfieldisadomain">Theorem</xref>.

    <p>
      For the reverse, assume <m>R</m> is a domain.
      Then <m>R</m> has no zero divisors.
      If <m>m</m> is composite,
      there exist integers <m>a,b</m> satisfying
      <m>1 \lt a,b \lt m</m> such that <m>m=ab</m>.
      Then <m>\overline{a},\overline{b}\ne \overline{0}</m> in <m>\Z_m</m>,
      but <m>\overline{a}\cdot \overline{b} = \overline{0}</m>.
      Thus, <m>m</m> may not be composite, and is therefore prime.
      By an earlier theorem, <m>\Z_p</m> is a field.

        If <m>R</m> is a domain and <m>S</m> is a subring of <m>R</m> with identity <m>1_S = 1_R</m>,
        then <m>S</m> is a domain.

    <p>
      Any zero divisors in <m>S</m> are also zero divisors in <m>R</m>.

    When considering sets of polynomials,

    the following results will be quite useful.

  <theorem xml:id="theorem_degreeofproductinfield">
    <statement>

        Let <m>R</m> be a domain,

      Then the leading term of <m>p(x) q(x)</m> is <m>a_n b_m x^{n+m}</m>.
      (Observe that since <m>R</m> is a domain, <m>a_n b_m \ne 0</m>.)

        The units are <m>R^\times</m>.
