	<p>
      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
  </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What are zero divisors?</li>
      <li>What are integral domains, and how do they relate to rings and fields?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
    
  <introduction>
  <p>
    In the realm of ring theory, certain rings behave similarly to <m>\Z</m>: 
    they are commutative and when we multiply any two non-zero integers it remains non-zero. Either (or both!) of these two properties are violated in 
    general rings. We've already encountered commutative rings and so we begin by formalizing the latter property.
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="ssec_zeroDivisors">
  <title>Zero Divisors</title>
  <p>
    One of the interesting side effects of our definition of <em>ring</em>
    is that it allows for behavior that may at first appear unintuitive or downright weird.
  </p>
  <definition>
  <idx>zero divisor</idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>zero divisor</term> in a ring <m>R</m> is a nonzero element <m>z\in R</m> such that there is a nonzero <m>x\in R</m> with <m>zx = 0</m> or <m>xz=0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Notice that the reason the idea of zero divisors at first appears weird is that they are not something we encounter when working with our familiar sets of numbers, such as <m>\Z</m> or <m>\R</m>.
    In fact, we specifically use the fact that there are no zero divisors in our familiar numbers systems to solve equations in high school algebra (e.g., if <m>(x-2)(x+5)=0</m>,
    then <m>x-2=0</m> or <m>x+5=0</m>).
    The lack of zero divisors is one of the properties that does not persist in our abstraction from the integers to rings in general.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and suppose
        <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor.
        Then either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is a zero divisor.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>a,b\in R</m> such that <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor.
      Then <m>a,b\ne 0</m>
      (else <m>ab = 0</m>).
      Since <m>ab</m> is a zero divisor,
      there is some <m>c\ne 0</m> such that <m>(ab) c = 0</m>.
      If <m>bc\ne 0</m>,
      then <m>a</m> is a zero divisor, as <m>a(bc) = 0</m>.
      On the other hand, if <m>bc=0</m>,
      then <m>b</m> is a zero divisor, as <m>b,c\ne 0</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="ssec_unitsAndAssociates"/> we defined units. Units are somehow opposite zero-divisors as the following theorem shows.

    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>u\in R^\times</m> and suppose <m>u</m> is a zero divisor.
      Then there is some <m>v\ne 0</m> such that <m>uv = 0</m>.

   <example xml:id="ex_gaussianIntegersAreDomain">
    <title>Gaussian Integers are a Domain</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Gaussian Integers <m>\Z[i]</m> are a domain. Indeed, they  
        are a subring of the field <m>\C</m>. We will see in <xref ref="thm_subringOfDomainIsDomain"/> 
        that this is sufficient to deduce they are a domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, we know that as a subring of a commutative ring, the multiplication in <m>\Z[i]</m> is commutative.
        Suppose there are <m>a+bi,c+di\in \Z[i]</m> such that their product is zero:
        <md>
          <mrow>0 \amp= (a+bi)\cdot (c+di)</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=(ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i </mrow>
        </md>
        which tells us <m>ac-bd=0</m> and <m>ad+bc=0</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at <m>ac=bd</m>. One of two cases happend: <m>a=0</m> or <m>a\ne 0</m>. If <m>a=0</m>, then 
        either <m>b=0</m> or <m>d=0</m> as <m>\Z</m> is a domain. If <m>b=0</m>, then <m>a+bi=0</m> as desired. 
        If <m>d=0</m>, then <m>ad+bc=0</m> tells us <m>bc=0</m>. Again, <m>b=0</m> or <m>c=0</m>. If <m>b=0</m>, 
        then <m>a+bi=0</m> and we are finished. Otherwise <m>c=0</m> and <m>c+di=0</m> and we are finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>a\ne 0</m>, then a similar analysis shows that none of <m>b,c,d</m> can be zero. Multiply <m>ac=bd</m> through by 
        <m>d</m> and multiply <m>ad=-bc</m> through by <m>c</m> we get: <m>acd = bd^2</m> and <m>acd=-bc^2</m>. Hence, 
        <m>bd^2=-bc^2</m> and since <m>b\ne 0</m> we can cancel it to get <m>d^2=-c^2</m>. The left hand side is positive while the right hand side 
        is negative, a contradiction. We conclude that <m>\Z[i]</m> does not have zero-divisors and it is therefore a domain.

  <title>Polynomial Rings are Domains</title>
 
  <p>
    We now show that the property of being a domain can be passed on to polynomial rings.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_domainImpliesPolynomialDomain">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>R</m> is a ring. Then <m>R</m> is a domain if and only if <m>R[x]</m> is a domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      For the forward direction, suppose that <m>R</m> is a domain. Let <m>f(x) = a_i x^i + a_{i+1} x^{i+1} + \cdots a_n x^n</m> and
      <m>g(x) = b_j x^j + b_{j+1} x^{j+1} + \cdots b_k x^k</m> be nonzero polynomials in <m>R[x]</m>, where <m>a_i, b_j \ne 0</m>.
      Then the lowest-degree term in <m>f(x) g(x)</m> is <m>a_i b_j x^{i+j}</m>. Since <m>R</m> is a domain, <m>a_i b_j\ne 0</m>,

        Given a field <m>F</m>, the set of polynomials <m>F[x]</m> is a domain. 
      </p>

  </corollary>
  
  <p>
    When considering sets of polynomials,
    as we do in <xref ref="sec-primesFactorization" /> (particularly in <xref ref="SubSec-Factoring-Polynomials" />),
    the following results will be quite useful.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_degreeOfProductInDomain">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a domain, and let <m>p(x),q(x)\in R[x]</m> be nonzero polynomials.
        Then <m>\deg(p(x)\cdot q(x)) = \deg(p(x)) + \deg(q(x))</m>.
      </p>

    <proof>
    <p>
      Let the leading term of <m>p(x)</m> be <m>a_n x^n</m> and the leading term of <m>q(x)</m> be <m>b_m x^m</m>.
      Then the leading term of <m>p(x) q(x)</m> is <m>a_n b_m x^{n+m}</m>.
      (Observe that since <m>R</m> is a domain, <m>a_n b_m \ne 0</m>.)
      Thus, <m>\deg(p(x) q(x)) = n+m = \deg(p(x)) + \deg(q(x))</m>.

          Can the hypotheses of <xref ref="thm_degreeOfProductInDomain" /> be relaxed? If so,
          provide more general hypotheses and adapt the proof. If not, give an illustrative example. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p> 
          If we were to relax the property of a domain we have two choices: relax commutativity or relax zero-divisors. 
          Relaxing commutativity means we are allowing for non-commutative coefficient rings, such as <m>M_2(\mathbb{Z})</m>. 
          Relaxing zero-divisors means allowing fro zero-divisors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we allow for zero-divisors, then the theorem fails: 
          Let <m>p = \overline{1} + \overline{2}x, q = \overline{2} + \overline{3}x\in \Z_6[x]</m>.
          Observe that <m>\deg(p) + \deg(q) = 1 + 1</m>, but <m>pq = \overline{2} + \overline{5}x</m>
          has degree 1. This is because the leading coefficients are zero-divisors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we allow for non-commutative rings without zero-divisors (we have not encountered any of these yet), then the 
          theorem remains true. Indeed, the leading coefficient of the product <m>p(x)\cdot q(x)</m> is the product of the leading coefficients. 
          Since our ring has no zero-divisors, the same proof works!
