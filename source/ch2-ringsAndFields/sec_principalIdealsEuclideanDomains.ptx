    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What are principal ideals, and what are principal ideal domains?</li>

    One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
    of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
    This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects.
    Thus, in linear algebra,
    we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em>
    of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
    or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
    (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
    In real analysis and topology,
    the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
    and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section,
    we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important class of subring which will be integral to our understanding of factorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    These subrings are called <em>ideals</em>.
    They arose in the work of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>I</m> of a
        (not necessarily commutative)
        ring <m>R</m> is called an <term>ideal</term> if:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>0\in I</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>x,y\in I</m>, <m>x+y\in I</m>; and,

          <li>
            <p>

  </definition>
  <p>
    Observe that the third requirement for a set <m>I</m> to be an ideal of <m>R</m> is simplified slightly if <m>R</m> is commutative
    (which, we recall, all of our rings are).
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many important examples and types of ideals,
    but there are also some trivial ideals contained in every ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
        Then <m>R</m> and <m>\set{0}</m> are ideals of <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        All ideals are subrings.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      It is straightforward to check that all conditions of <xref ref="theorem_subringtest">Theorem</xref> are satisfied.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The following theorem provides a useful characterization of when an ideal <m>I</m> is in fact the whole ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        Then <m>I = R</m> if and only if <m>I</m> contains a unit of <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>I = R</m>, <m>1\in R</m> will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a unit <m>u\in I</m>,
      then given any <m>r\in R</m>,
      <m>r = r u^{-1} u = (ru^{-1}) u \in I</m>, so <m>I = R</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The most important type of ideals
    (for our work, at least),
    are those which are the sets of all multiples of a single element in the ring.
    Such ideals are called <em>principal ideals</em>.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>a\in R</m>.
        The set
        <me>
          \ideal{a} = \setof{ra}{r\in R}
        </me>
        is an ideal
        (called the <em>principal ideal generated by <m>a</m></em>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = 0\cdot a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if <m>r_1 a, r_2 a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
      <m>r_1 a - r_2 a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
      Finally, if <m>x\in R</m> and <m>r a\in \ideal{a}</m>,
      <m>x (ra) = (xr) a \in \ideal{a}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>\ideal{a}</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The element <m>a</m> in the theorem is known as a
    <em>generator</em> of <m>\ideal{a}</m>.

        Give necessary and sufficient conditions for <m>z\in \ideal{x}</m> and,
        separately,

      </p>

    <answer>
      <p>
        We have
        <q><m>z\in \ideal{x} \Leftrightarrow x|z</m></q>
        and
        <q><m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y} \Leftrightarrow y|x</m></q><fn>
        An acceptable alternative would be:
        <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>.
        Make sure students are aware of this!
        </fn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <m>z\in \ideal{x} \Leftrightarrow \exists r\in R, z = xr \Leftrightarrow x|z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, suppose <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>.
        Then <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>, so <m>y|x</m>.
        Conversely, if <m>y|x</m>,
        then there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>x = yr</m>,
        and thus for all <m>ax\in \ideal{x}</m>,
        <m>ax = (ar)y \in \ideal{y}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this means that if we want to know if <m>\ideal{x}\subseteq \ideal{y}</m>,
        it's enough to check that <m>x\in \ideal{y}</m>.

    It is the case in many familiar settings that all ideals are principal.
    Such domains are given a special name.

      Let <m>I\subseteq Z</m> be an ideal.

      Observe that <m>0 \le r = x - dq \lt d</m>,
      but as <m>x\in I</m> and <m>-dq \in I</m>,
      we must have <m>r\in I</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>I</m> is an ideal, so there is some <m>d\in R</m> for which <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>;

      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that there exist
        <m>s,t\in R</m> such that <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = x0 + y0 \in I</m>.
      Additionally, if <m>x m_1 + y n_1, x m_2 + y n_2\in I</m>,
      then <m>(x m_1 + y n_1) + (x m_2 + y n_2) = x (m_1 + m_2) + y (n_1 + n_2) \in I</m>,
      and <m>r(x m_1 + y n_1) = x (rm_1) + y(rn_1) \in I</m>.
      Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there exists <m>d\in R</m> such that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.
      We claim that <m>d</m> is a GCD of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that <m>d|x</m>, as <m>x\cdot 1 + y\cdot 0\in I = \ideal{d}</m>.
      Similarly, <m>d|y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>e\in R</m> be a common divisor of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      We wish to show that <m>e|d</m>.
      Write <m>x = e k_1</m> and <m>y = e k_2</m>.
      Since <m>d\in \ideal{d}</m>,
      there exist <m>s,t\in R</m> such that
      <m>d = x s + yt = (e k_1) s + (e k_2)t = e(k_1 s + k_2 t)</m>,
      and thus <m>e|d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, there exist
      <m>s,t\in R</m> such that a GCD <m>d</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    We have so far abstracted and axiomatized several important algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m> that we discussed in <xref ref="Sec-Integers">&#xa7;</xref>.
    In particular,
    we have our usual operations of addition and multiplication,
    and their interactions;
    we have notions of divisibility/factorization,
    irreducibility, and primality;
    we also have cancellation and greatest common divisors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our last major abstraction from <m>\Z</m> is the division algorithm.
    The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations.
    That is, if <m>R</m> is an arbitrary domain with <m>r,s\in R</m>,
    is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <m>r</m> or <m>s</m> is
    <q>bigger</q>
    ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However,
    if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <m>R</m> to <m>\N_0</m>,
    we can sensibly define a division algorithm.

    Thus, a Euclidean domain is an integral domain with a division algorithm that behaves in a familiar way. In the remainder of this section, we will investigate the properties of Euclidean domains.
    First, we consider some examples.

          The field <m>\Q</m> is a Euclidean domain under ordinary addition and multiplication, with <m>\delta(x) = 0</m> for all <m>x\in \Q</m>.

        Is <m>\Z</m> a Euclidean domain?
        If so, what is the norm function <m>\delta</m>,
        and why does this function have the required properties of a norm?
      </p>

    <answer>
      <p>
        Yes.
        The norm is the absolute value function.

        <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
        In the last case, use induction on <m>m = \deg f(x)</m>.
        For uniqueness,
        mimic the uniqueness proof of <xref ref="thm_divalg">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      <em>Existence:</em> If <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
      then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = 0</m> will do.
      If <m>f(x)\ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>,
      then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = f(x)</m> will suffice.
      Thus, we need only consider the case in which
      <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
      We use induction on <m>\deg f = m</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <m>m = 0</m>, <m>\deg g \le 0 = \deg f</m>,
      and as <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>, both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are nonzero constants.
      Then <m>r = 0</m> and <m>q = fg^{-1}</m> will work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist whenever <m>\deg f \lt m</m>.
      Assume <m>\deg f = m</m> and write
      <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m</m> and <m>g(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n</m>.
      Use <xref ref="lem_polydivalglem">Lemma</xref>
      and set <m>h(x) = f(x) - a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x)</m>,
      which must have degree less than <m>f</m>.
      Thus, by induction, there exist
      <m>q_1, r_1\in F[x]</m> such that <m>h = g q_1 + r_1</m>,
      with <m>r_1 = 0</m> or <m>\deg r_1 \lt \deg g</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore have
      <md>
        <mrow>f(x) \amp = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x) + h(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x) + g(x) q_1(x) + r_1(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)) g(x) + r_1(x)</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>q = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)</m> and
      <m>r = r_1(x)</m> have the desired properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Uniqueness:</em> Suppose
      <m>f = gq + r</m> and <m>f = g\hat{q} + \hat{r}</m>,
      where <m>r,\hat{r}</m> both have the desired properties.
      Then
      <me>
        0 = g[q - \hat{q}] + [r - \hat{r}]
      </me>,
      or <m>\hat{r} - r = g [q - \hat{q}]</m>.
      Thus either <m>\hat{r} - r = 0</m>,
      or <m>\hat{r} - r</m> has degree at least <m>\deg g</m>.
      The latter is clearly impossible,
      so <m>\hat{r} = r</m> and <m>\hat{q} = q</m>.

    <p>
      Let <m>R</m> be a euclidean domain,
      and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
      If <m>I = \set{0}</m>, then <m>I</m> is principal,
      so assume that <m>I\ne \set{0}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>S = \setof{\delta(x)>0}{x\in I}</m>.
      Then the Well-Ordering Principle guarantees that <m>S</m> has a least element.
      Let <m>d\in I</m> be such that <m>\delta(d) > 0</m> is minimal.
      We claim that <m>I = \ideal{d}</m>.

    <p>

      Now assume that <m>a\in I</m>,

      If <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(d)</m>,
      then <m>r = a - dq \in I</m>,
      contradicting the minimality of <m>\delta(d)</m>.
      Thus, <m>r = 0</m>, and <m>a\in \ideal{d}</m>.
