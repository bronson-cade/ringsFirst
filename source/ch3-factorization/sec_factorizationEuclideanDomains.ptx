    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What is a unique factorization domain? What examples of UFDs do we possess?</li>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    		In this section, our explorations of the structural arithmetic properties that guarantee unique factorization culminate in <xref ref="theorem_everyedisufd" />.
    		Specifically, we'll see that all Euclidean domains possess the unique factorization property.
    		To prove this theorem, we will rely in part on an interesting property of <em>chains</em> of ideals in Euclidean domains.

    	<title>The Ascending Chain Condition and Noetherian Rings</title>

    <p>
      We now set our sights on a proof of <xref ref="theorem_everyedisufd" />.
      In order to prove it, we will make use of an important property of ideals in Euclidean domains.
      First, a definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-noetherian">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A commutative ring <m>R</m> is called <term>Noetherian</term>
          if it satisfies the <term>ascending chain condition</term> on ideals. <aside>
These rings are named in honor of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</url>, one of the preeminent mathematicians of the 20th century. In addition to making substantial contributions to physics, she formalized the axiomatic definition of <em>ring</em> that is still in use today.

          That is, <m>R</m> is Noetherian if whenever

            I_1 \subseteq I_2\subseteq I_3\subseteq \cdots
          </me>

    <subsection>
    	<title>Euclidean Domains are UFDs</title>

    
    <p>
    	We now begin collecting results to prove that every Euclidean domain is a UFD.
    	The first condition in the UFD definition is that every nonzero nonunit factors as a product of irreducibles.
    	We first show that every nonzero nonunit is divisible by at least one irreducible (<xref ref="lem_divisiblebyirred" />), which we apply to show that every nonzero nonunit can be written as a finite product of irreducibles (<xref ref="thm-writeasprodofirred" />).
    	</p>


    
    <lemma xml:id="lem_divisiblebyirred">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a principal ideal domain,
          and <m>r\in R</m> a nonzero nonunit.
          Then <m>r</m> is divisible by an irreducible.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Let <m>r\in R</m> be reducible and write <m>r = r_1 r_2</m>.
          Continue to factor reducibles and build an ascending chain of ideals.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r</m> is not irreducible.
        Write <m>r = r_1 r_2</m>, where the <m>r_i</m> are nonzero nonunits.
        Then <m>\ideal{r} \subsetneq \ideal{r_1}</m>.
        If <m>r_1</m> is not irreducible,
        we may write <m>r_1 = r_{1,1}r_{1,2}</m>,
        where <m>r_{1,1},r_{1,2}</m> are nonzero nonunits, and observe that
        <me>
          \ideal{r} \subsetneq \ideal{r_1}\subsetneq \ideal{r_{1,1}}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (If <m>r_1</m> <em>is</em> irreducible and we nonetheless write <m>r_1 = r_{1,1} r_{1,2}</m>,
        then either <m>\ideal{r_{1,1}} = R</m> if <m>r_{1,1}</m> is a unit,
        or <m>\ideal{r_{1,1}} = \ideal{r_1}</m> if <m>r_{1,1}</m> is associate to <m>r_1</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in this way,
        we may continue to factor the reducible factors of <m>r_1</m>;
        since <m>R</m> is a PID and thus has the ascending chain condition,
        we must eventually reach a point where the chain stabilizes,
        i.e., that we have found an irreducible factor of <m>r_1</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </lemma>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm-writeasprodofirred">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a PID. Then every nonzero nonunit element of <m>R</m> is either irreducible or can be written as a finite product of irreducibles in <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        We may perform the analysis from <xref ref="lem_divisiblebyirred">Lemma</xref> for all factors of <m>r</m>,
        and thus <m>r</m> can be factored into a product of irreducibles.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    	The second condition that must be satisfied for a domain to be a UFD is that the product of irreducibles must be unique (up to associates).
    	In order to prove that, we will make use of <xref ref="thm-primesareirredinPID" />, which states that in PIDs, primes and irreducibles are identical concepts.

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>p\in R</m> be irreducible.
          Let <m>a\in R</m> be such that <m>p\nmid a</m>.
          Then <m>1\in I = \setof{ax+py}{x,y\in R}</m> and thus there exist
          <m>s,t\in R</m> such that <m>1 = as+pt</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>p</m> is irreducible.
        Suppose that <m>p</m> divides <m>ab</m> for some
        <m>a,b \in R</m> and that <m>p</m> does not divide <m>a</m>.
        Since <m>R</m> is a PID, <m>I = \ideal{\gcd(a,p)} = \ideal{1}</m>.
        Thus there exists <m>s,t\in R</m> such that <m>1=as+pt</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-primesareirredinPID">

          Let <m>R</m> be a PID and let <m>p\in R</m>.
          Then <m>p</m> is prime if and only if <m>p</m> is irreducible.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>p=ab</m> for some <m>a,b \in R</m>.
        Then <m>p</m> divides <m>ab</m> which implies that <m>p</m> divides <m>a</m> or <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m>.
        WLOG, assume that <m>p</m> divides <m>a</m>.
        Then there exists <m>c\in R</m> such that <m>a=pc</m> which implies that <m>p=pcb</m>.
        Therefore <m>cb=1</m> and <m>b</m> is a unit which implies that <m>p</m> is irreducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>p</m> is irreducible.
        Suppose that <m>p</m> divides <m>ab</m> for some
        <m>a,b \in R</m> and that <m>p</m> does not divide <m>a</m>.
        Then <m>\ideal{a,p}=R</m> and there exists
        <m>x,y\in R</m> such that <m>1=ax+py</m>.
        Multiplying boths sides by <m>b</m> yiels
        <m>b=abx+pby=p(cx+by)</m> which implies that <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m> and therefore <m>p</m> is prime.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    	Observe that <xref ref="thm-primesareirredinPID" /> implies that if <m>R</m> is a PID and <m>p\in R</m> is irreducible with <m>p|ab</m>, then <m>p|a</m> or <m>p|b</m>.

 		Our crucial final step on the road to <xref ref="theorem_everyedisufd" /> is the following.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_pidisufd">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every PID is a UFD.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
      	For part 2 of the definition, use induction on the number of irreducible divisors of an arbitrary nonzero nonunit.
      	Mimic the proof of <xref ref="theorem_FTAuniqueness" />.
      </hint>
      <proof>
      	<p>
      		Let <m>R</m> be a PID, and observe that by <xref ref="thm-writeasprodofirred" /> every nonzero nonunit can be written as a product of irreducibles.
      		We thus need only show that this product is unique (up to associates).
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		To that end, we adopt the notation of <xref ref="def-ufd" />.
      		Let <m>s\in R</m>.
      		We perform induction on the number of irreducible factors <m>k</m> of <m>s</m>.
      		If <m>k=0</m>, then <m>s</m> is a unit.
      		If we had <m>s = pa</m> for some irreducible <m>p</m>, then <m>p</m> divides a unit and would thus be a unit itself, which is a contradiction.
      		</p>
			<p>
			Suppose now that <m>k\ge 1</m> and we write
			<me>
                  s = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k \text{ and }  s = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_m, \ m \ge k,
                </me>
            where the <m>p_i</m> and <m>q_j</m> are not necessarily distinct irreducibles.
            Since <m>p_1 | q_1 q_2 \cdots q_m</m>, we know by <xref ref="thm-primesareirredinPID" /> that <m>p_1</m> must divide one of the factors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Renumbering, we may assume that <m>p_1 | q_1</m>, whence <m>q_1 = p_1 v_1</m>, where <m>v_1</m> must be a unit as <m>q_1</m> is irreducible.
				Canceling <m>p_1</m> yields
				<me>
					p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k = v_1 q_2 q_3 \cdots q_n, m\ge k.
				</me>
			By induction on <m>k</m> we conclude that each of the irreducible factors on the left matches with precisely one factor on the right (up to associates).
			This completes the inductive step, and thus the proof.

 <!-- 
     <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and suppose that a non-zero non-unit element <m>a\in R</m> can be factored in two different ways as a product of irreducibles.
        <me>
          a=p_1p_2\cdots p_r=q_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume that <m>s\geq r</m>.
        Since <m>p_1</m> is irreducible
        (and therefore prime),
        there exists <m>j</m> such that <m>p_1 \mid q_j</m>, so <m>q_j = p_1 v_1</m>.
        Since <m>q_j</m> and <m>p_1</m> are irreducible,
        there is a unit <m>u_1 = v_1^{-1}</m> such that <m>p_1=u_1 q_j</m>.
        Up to reordering we have
        <me>
          p_1p_2\cdots p_r=u_1p_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore
        <me>
          p_2\cdots p_r=u_1q_2\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can continue in a similar fashion until we end up with

          1=u_1\cdots u_rq_{r+1}\cdots q_s
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the <m>q_j</m>'s are non-units,
        this means that <m>r=s</m> and that the <m>p_i</m>'s are associates of the <m>q_j</m>'s.
        Therefore <m>R</m> is a UFD.

      Thus, we see that the existence of a well-behaved division algorithm (and a lack of zero divisors) is sufficient to guarantee unique factorization. 
      However, it is not necessary.
      The following theorem is included for reference, but is not intended to be proved.

      Thus, <m>\Z[x]</m> is a UFD. That is, every nonconstant polynomial in <m>\Z[x]</m> is either irreducible or can be factored uniquely into a product of irreducibles.  However,
      as we will see later, <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a PID.
