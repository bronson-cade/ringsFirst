    <introduction>
		<p>
      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>How can unique factorization fail, and why does it matter?</li>
      <li>What is an example of a nonatomic domain?</li>
      <li>What is an example of an element that does not factor uniquely into a product of irreducibles?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
  <p>
    Despite the evidence to the contrary, not every ring has the unique factorization property. That is, there are commutative rings with identity which are not UFDs. <!-- 
If every ring had the unique factorization property,
    life would be very boring indeed.
-->
    In fact,
    the failure of certain rings in algebraic number theory to have the unique factorization property played a role in several failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,
    which says that there are no nontrivial integer solutions <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the equation <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> if <m>n \ge 3</m>.
    Pierre de Fermat famously claimed that he had a <q>marvelous proof</q> of this fact, but the margin of the book in which he was writing was <q>too narrow to contain it.</q>
    Fermat's supposed proof was never found, and many now doubt that he had one.
    The search for a valid proof would not be complete until the work of Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in the mid-1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1847, Gabriel Lam&#xe9; claimed he had completely solved the problem.
    His solution relied on the factorization of <m>x^p + y^p</m>,
    where <m>p</m> is an odd prime, as
    <me>
      x^p + y^p = (x+y)(x+\zeta y) \cdots (x+\zeta^{p-1}y)
    </me>,
    where <m>\zeta = e^{2\pi i/p}</m> is a primitive <m>p</m>-th root of unity in <m>\C</m>.
    However, the ring <m>\Z[\zeta] = \setof{a_0 + a_1 \zeta + a_2 \zeta^2 + \cdots + a_{p-1} \zeta^{p-1}}{a_i\in\Z}</m> is not a unique factorization domain.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two ways that unique factorization in an integral domain can fail: there can be a failure of a nonzero nonunit to factor into irreducibles, or there can be nonassociate factorizations of the same element. We investigate each in turn.

     <title>A non-atomic domain</title>
     <statement>
       <p>
         We say an integral domain <m>R</m> is <term>atomic</term> if every nonzero nonunit can be written as a finite product of irreducibles in <m>R</m>. <aside>
The term <em>atom</em> was suggested by <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohn">Paul Cohn</url> as a synonym for irreducible.
</aside>
         In this exploration, we encounter a non-atomic domain.
       </p>
    <p>
      Let 
      <md>
        <mrow>R \amp = \Z + x\Q[x]</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \setof{a + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \cdots + b_n x^n}{a\in \Z, b_1,\ldots, b_n \in \Q, n\ge 0},</mrow>
      </md>
the set of polynomials with integer constant terms and rational coefficients.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Convince yourself that <m>R</m> is an integral domain. You do not need to prove it in detail, but you should at least argue that <m>R</m> is closed under the usual polynomial addition and multiplication, and that <m>R</m> is a domain.</li>
      <li>Describe the irreducibles in <m>R</m>.</li>
      <li>Use the notion of degree to argue that any factorization of <m>x</m> in <m>R</m> has the form 
      <me>
        x = m\left(\frac{x}{m}\right).
      </me>
    </li>
      <li>Explain why the factorization in the previous part cannot lead to a factorization of <m>x</m> into irreducibles in <m>R</m>.</li>
    </ol>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      TBD.
    </solution>
  </exploration>

<p>
    We now explore the atomic domain <m>R = \Z[\sqrt{-7}] = \setof{a+b\sqrt{-7}}{a,b\in\Z}</m>.
    As we will see, even when a nonzero nonunit can be written as a product of irreducibles, it may be the case that this factorization is not unique. 
  </p>
  <activity>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Verify that <m>8 = (1+\sqrt{-7})(1-\sqrt{-7})</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>
  
  <p>
    Next, we develop a multiplicative function <m>\delta</m> which enables us to explore the multiplicative properties of <m>\Z[\sqrt{-7}]</m>.
    </p>


  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Define <m>\delta : R \to \N_0</m> by <m>\delta(a+b\sqrt{-7}) = a^2 + 7 b^2</m>.
        Then for all <m>x,y\in R</m>,
        <m>\delta(xy) = \delta(x)\delta(y)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An element <m>u\in R</m> is a unit if and only if <m>\delta(u) = 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>u</m> is a unit if and only if <m>uv = 1</m> for some <m>v</m>,
      which menas that <m>1 = \delta(1) = \delta(u) \delta(v)</m>,
      so <m>\delta(u) = \delta(v) = 1</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There do not exist <m>x,y\in \N_0</m> such that <m>2 = x^2 + 7y^2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose there exist <m>x,y\in \N_0</m> such that <m>2 = x^2 + y^2</m>.
      Then we must have <m>y = 0</m>,
      which means that <m>x^2 = 2</m>, a contradiction.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The elements 2, <m>1+ \sqrt{-7}</m>,
        and <m>1-\sqrt{-7}</m> are irreducible in <m>R</m>.
        We conclude that <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>2 = ab</m>.
      Then <m>4 = \delta(2) = \delta(a)\delta(b)</m>.
      By the lemma, we may not have <m>\delta(a) = 2</m>,
      which means without loss of generality that <m>\delta(a) = 1</m>,
      and thus <m>a</m> is a unit.
      Therefore, 2 is irreducible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now suppose that <m>1 + \sqrt{-7} = ab</m>.
      Then <m>8 = \delta(1+\sqrt{-7}) = \delta(a) \delta(b)</m>.
      The possible values for <m>\delta(a)</m> are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
      If <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8, then <m>1+\sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible,
      as either <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is necessarily a unit.
      By the lemma, we may not have
      <m>\delta(a) = 2</m> or <m>\delta(b) = 2</m>,
      so in fact either <m>\delta(a) = 1</m> or 8.
      Therefore, <m>1\pm \sqrt{-7}</m> is irreducible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we have factored 8 into two different products of irreducibles,
      <m>R</m> is not a UFD.
    </p>
  </proof>
