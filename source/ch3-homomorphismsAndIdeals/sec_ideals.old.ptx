    <introduction>
		<p>
      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What are ideals?</li>
      <li>What operations can we perform on existing ideals to create new ideals?</li>
      <li>How can we describe (non-principal) ideals in general?</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall that one of the ways in which we understand a mathematical object is to study its relationship to other mathematical objects.
      In algebra, we learn about a ring by studying its relationship to other rings via functions (introduced in <xref ref="SubSec-Homomorphisms" />) and to its ideals, introduced in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The notion of an ideal number was first introduced by Ernst Kummer in the middle of the nineteenth century.
      Kummer was studying the cyclotomic integers in connection to work on Fermat's Last Theorem and reciprocity laws in number theory, and discovered, to use our modern terminology, that these rings of cyclotomic integers were not UFDs.
      In particular, he found irreducible cyclotomic integers that were not prime.
      His work, which was finished by Richard Dedekind by 1871, was to define a new class of complex number, an <em>ideal number</em> for which unique factorization into prime ideal numbers held.
      A related notion was developed by Kronecker and Lasker, before the two concepts were unified by David Hilbert and Emmy Noether into the more general version which we stated in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this section, we explore ways of describing non-principal ideals.
      We also explore properties of ideals, as well as their connections to other fields of mathematics.
    </p>



</introduction>

<p>
    We first explore the behavior of ideals under the usual set-theoretic operations of intersection and union.
  </p>


<theorem xml:id="thm-idealintersection">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>R</m> be a ring and let
      <m>\set{I_{\alpha}}_{\alpha\in \Gamma}</m> be a family of ideals.
      Then <m>I = \bigcap\limits_{\alpha\in \Gamma} I_\alpha</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
  <p>
  It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>.
  Moreover, if <m>x,y\in I</m>,
  then <m>x,y\in I_\alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>,
  so <m>x-y\in I_\alpha</m> and thus <m>x-y\in I</m>.
  Finally, if <m>x\in I</m> and <m>r\in R</m>,
  <m>rx\in I_\alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha</m>, and thus <m>rx\in I</m>.
  </p>
    </proof>
</theorem>

<investigation xml:id="invest-idealunion">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I,J\subseteq R</m> be ideals.
        Must <m>I\cup J</m> be an ideal of <m>R</m>?
        Give a proof or counterexample of your assertion.
      </p>
    </statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    Given <m>R = \Z</m>, <m>I = \ideal{2}</m>, and <m>J = \ideal{3}</m>, note that since <m>5 = 2 + 3\notin I\cup J</m>, the union <m>I\cup J</m> is not an ideal.
  </p>
</solution>
</investigation>

<p>
 In addition to the set-theoretic properties described above, we can do arithmetic with ideals. 
</p>

<theorem>
   <statement>
     <p>
       Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I,J\subseteq R</m> ideals of <m>R</m>.
       Then the <term>sum</term> of <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>,
       <me>
         I+J := \setof{x+y}{x\in I, y\in J},
       </me>
       is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
       Furthermore, the <term>product</term> of <m>I</m> and <m>J</m>,
       <me>
         IJ := \setof{x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \cdots + x_n y_n}{n\ge 1, x_i \in I, y_j\in J}
       </me>
       is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
     </p>
   </statement>
<proof>
  TBD.
</proof>
</theorem>



<p>
  When we studied principal ideals, we were able to describe the principal ideal in terms of a single generating element.
  However, not every ideal is principal (see the <xref ref="challenge-nonprincideal">Challenge</xref>).
  Still, we would like a way to more precisely describe the elements of such ideals; we begin with <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" />.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def_idealgeneration">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity,
      and let <m>S\subseteq R</m> be a subset.
      Then
      <men xml:id="eq_idealgeneratedbyset">
        \langle S \rangle := \bigcap\limits_{\substack{J\supseteq S\\\text{ \(J\) is an ideal } } } J
      </men>
      is called the <term>ideal generated by <m>S</m></term><idx>ideal generated by a set</idx>, and we call <m>S</m> the <term>generating set for the ideal</term>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
<p>
  A consequence of <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is the following theorem.
</p>
<theorem>
<statement>
  Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
  Then <m>\ideal{\emptyset} = \set{0}</m>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>	
  Observe that for all ideals <m>J</m> in <m>R</m>, <m>\emptyset\subseteq J</m>.
  In particular, one of the ideals in the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" /> is the zero ideal.
  Since the zero ideal is a subset of all ideals, the theorem follows. 
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>



<p>
   One way to interpret <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is that <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal (with respect to subset inclusion) that contains <m>S</m>.
</p>
<theorem xml:id="theorem-smallestideal">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Given a commutative ring <m>R</m> and a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>,
      <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal containing <m>S</m> in the sense that, if <m>J</m> is any ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>S</m>, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq J</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
  <p>
    Let <m>I</m> be any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
    Thus, <m>I</m> is one of the ideals on the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" />.
    Since <m>\ideal{S}</m> is formed by the intersection of <m>I</m> with other ideals,
    <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
  </p>
  </proof>
</theorem>

<p>
    The concept elucidated by <xref ref="theorem-smallestideal" /> is helpful, but does not give us a handle on the structure of the elements of <m>\ideal{S}</m>.
   Such a description is provided by <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" />.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_idealgeneratingset">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Given a commutative ring with identity <m>R</m> and a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>:
      <ol>
        <li>The set <m>I = \setof{r_1 s_1 + r_2 s_2 + \cdots + r_n s_n}{r_i\in R, \ s_j \in S,\ n\ge 1}</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>;</li>
        <li> <m>S\subseteq I</m>; and</li>
        <li> <m>I = \ideal{S}</m>.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
 <!-- 
<hint>
    <p>
      Begin by showing that <m>I=\setof{r_1 s_1 + r_2 s_2 + \cdots + r_n s_n}{r_i\in R, \ s_j \in S,\ n\ge 1}</m> is an ideal containing <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </hint>
-->
  <proof>

  <p>
    It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>,
    and that if <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in I</m>, <m>rx\in I</m>.
    Moreover, the sum of two <m>R</m>-linear combinations of elements of <m>S</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>S</m>.
    Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
    Further, if <m>s\in S</m>,
    <m>1\cdot s \in I</m>, so <m>S\subseteq I</m>.
    Therefore, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now assume that <m>x\in I</m>.
    Then <m>x</m> has the form <m>x = r_1 s_1 + \cdots + r_n s_n</m>.
    Each <m>s_i \in S</m>, so each
    <m>r_i s_i \in J</m> if <m>J</m> is any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
    In particular, <m>r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>,
    and thus the sum <m>x = \sum r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>.
  </p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
 In other words, the ideal <m>\ideal{S}</m> contains all possible finite <q><m>R</m>-linear combinations</q> of elements of <m>S</m>; that is, it contains all finite sums of products of ring elements with elements from <m>S</m>.
</p>



<definition>
  <p>
    If <m>R</m> is a ring and
    <m>S = \set{s_1, s_2, \ldots,
    s_n}</m> is a finite subset of <m>R</m>,
    the ideal <m>I</m> generated by <m>S</m> is denoted by <m>I = \ideal{s_1, s_2, \ldots,
    s_n}</m>, and we say <m>I</m> is <term>finitely generated</term><idx>ideal, finitely generated</idx>.
  </p>
</definition>

<principle xml:id="challenge-nonprincideal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The ring <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a PID.
      </p>
  <hint>
    <p>
    Consider the ideal <m>I = \langle 2, x \rangle</m>.
    </p>
  </hint>
    </statement>
<proof>
  <p>
  Suppose that <m>I = \ideal{a(x)}</m>.
  Since <m>2\in I</m>,
  <m>2 = c(x) a(x)</m> for some <m>c(x)\in \Z[x]</m>,
  so <m>\deg c(x) = \deg a(x) = 0</m>,
  and thus <m>a(x) = a\in \Z</m>.
  We also have <m>x\in I</m>, so <m>x = b(x) a</m>,
  which implies that <m>\deg b(x) = 1</m>,
  so <m>b(x) = b_1 x + b_0</m> for some <m>b_1,b_0\in \Z</m>.
  Then <m>x = (b_1 x + b_0)a</m> implies <m>b_1 a = 1</m>.
  Thus, <m>a = 1</m> or <m>a = -1</m>.
  In either case,
  <m>a</m> is a unit in <m>\Z[x]</m> so <m>1\in I</m>.
  By <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset">Theorem</xref>,
  there are polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> such that <m>1 = 2p(x) + xq(x)</m>.
  If <m>p_0</m> is the constant term of <m>p(x)</m>,
  it follows that the constant term of <m>2p(x) + xq(x)</m> is
  <m>2p_0 = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.
  </p>
  <p>
  Thus, <m>I</m> is not principal.
  </p>
</proof>
</principle>

 <p>
    Note that the set <m>S</m> in <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" /> need not be finite. 
    However, in many familiar rings, every ideal will have a finite generating set, as the next theorem demonstrates.
</p>

<theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
        If <m>R</m> is Noetherian<fn>Recall <xref ref="def-noetherian" />.</fn>, then every ideal <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.
      </p>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Consider an arbitrary ideal <m>I</m> and inductively build an ascending chain of finitely generated ideals contained in <m>I</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </statement>
<proof>
  <p>
    Assume that <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
    Inductively build an ascending chain of ideals as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Let <m>x_1 \in I</m> be arbitrary.</li>
      <li>For all <m>i\ge 2</m>, let <m>x_i \in I\setminus \ideal{x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}}</m> be arbitrary.</li>
    </ul>
    We thus obtain an ascending chain of ideals
    <me>
      \ideal{x_1} \subseteq \ideal{x_1, x_2}\subseteq \ideal{x_1,x_2,x_3}\subseteq \cdots
    </me>
    which must stabilize at <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.
    That is, at some point, <m>I\setminus \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n} = \emptyset</m>, and since <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}\subseteq I</m>, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.
  </p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
    In fact, we could have used the finite generation of ideals as the definition of Noetherian rings, as the two notions are equivalent.
    First, a lemma.
</p>

<lemma xml:id="lemma-ascendingchainideal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I_1 \subseteq I_2\subseteq I_3\subseteq \cdots </m> an ascending chain of ideals.
        Then <me>I = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^\infty I_j</me> is an ideal.
      </p>
</statement>
<proof>
  <p>
    Straightforward definition check.
    Nearly identical to <xref ref="theorem-pidisnoetherian" />.
  </p>

</proof>

</lemma>

<theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring such that every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.
        Then <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
      </p>
</statement>
<hint>
  <p>
    Argue that the ideal <m>I</m> defined in <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" /> is a finitely generated ideal of <m>R</m>, and use this to conclude that the ascending chain stabilizes.
  </p>
</hint>
<proof>
  <p>
    Following the hint and <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" />, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}</m> while <m>I_j\subseteq I</m> for all <m>j</m>.
    Since <m>I = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^\infty I_j</m>, for each <m>k, 1\le k \le n</m>, there is a <m>j_k</m> satisfying <m>x_k \in I_{j_k}</m>.
    What is more, we may rename <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m> so that <m>j_1 \le j_2 \le \ldots \le j_n</m> and thus
    <me>
      I_{j_1} \subseteq I_{j_2}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq I_{j_n}.
    </me>
    Observe that this means that <m>x_{j_k}\in I_{j_n}</m> for all <m>k</m>, so that <m>I = I_{j_n}</m>.
    Thus, the chain stabilizes, and <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
  </p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
    As one might expect, not every ring is Noetherian. However, most familiar rings are.
  </p>

<exploration>
<statement>
  <p>
    Show that the ring <m>R = \Q[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots]</m> of polynomials in infinitely many variables over <m>\Q</m> is not Noetherian either by exhibiting an ascending chain of ideals that never stabilizes, or an ideal without a finite generating set.
  </p>
</statement>
<solution>

    TBD.

<p>
    We close with a discussion of a class of ideals which are the object of active mathematical research.
    Recall that a (simple) graph <m>G</m> consists of a set <m>V = \set{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}</m> of <em>vertices</em> together with a collection <m>E</m> of <em>edges</em>, which are just pairs of vertices and can be written <m>x_i x_j</m>.
    This notation suggests the following definition.
  </p>


<definition xml:id="def-edge-ideal">
<p>
  Let <m>K</m> be a field, <m>G</m> a graph on the vertex set <m>V = \set{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}</m> with edge set <m>E</m>, and let <m>R = K[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]</m> be the ring of polynomials whose variables are the vertices of <m>G</m> with coefficients in <m>K</m>.
  Define the <term>edge ideal</term><idx>ideal, edge</idx> of <m>G</m> to be
  <me>
    I(G) := \ideal{x_i x_j \mid x_i x_j\in E}.
  </me>
  That is, <m>I(G)</m> is generated by the products of the variables corresponding to the edges of the graph.
</p>
</definition>

<activity>
<statement>
  <p>
    Consider the graph <m>G</m> in <xref ref="graph" />.
    List the generators of <m>I(G)</m> and an appropriate ring in which <m>I(G)</m> may live.
  </p>

</statement>

<figure xml:id="graph">

<caption>A graph <m>G</m>.</caption>
</figure>

<p>
As one might hope, we do not make <xref ref="def-edge-ideal" /> merely for fun; given a graph <m>G</m>, it is possible to relate the graph-theoretic properties of <m>G</m> (e.g., the chromatic number) with the ideal-theoretic properties of <m>I(G)</m>.
