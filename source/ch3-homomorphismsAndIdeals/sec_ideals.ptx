  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
      of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
      This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects. Thus, in linear algebra,
      we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em> of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
      or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
      (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
      In real analysis and topology, the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
      and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration 
      of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important 
      class of subsets which will be integral to our understanding of 
      factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These subsets are called <em>ideals</em>. They arose in the work 
      of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of 
      unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the 
      fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

  We first return to the kernel of a ring homomorphism introduced in <xref ref="ssec_kernelOfAHomomorphism"/>. While the following proposition might seem odd, 
  it will lead us to the definition of an ideal.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop_kernelIsIdeal">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a ring homomorphism and <m>\ker\varphi</m> be its kernel. For any <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x,y\in \ker\varphi</m>, we have:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>rx\in\ker\varphi</m> and <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Pick <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=0</m>. Then 
      <me>\varphi(rx) = \varphi(r)\varphi(x) = \varphi(r)\cdot 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>rx\in \ker\varphi</m>. The proof of <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m> is similar 
      and is left as an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second claim, take <m>x,y\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=\varphi(y)=0</m>. Then 
      we have
      <me>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x)+\varphi(y) = 0 + 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</proposition>

<activity>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Mimic the proof of <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal"/> to show that whenever 
      <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism and <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in \ker\varphi</m>, then

  <p>
    The following definition of an <em>ideal</em> is an attempt to generalize 
    the properties that kernels have.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_ideal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>I</m> of a (not necessarily commutative) ring <m>R</m> is called an <term>ideal</term> if:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>0\in I</m>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>x,y\in I</m>, <m>x+y\in I</m>; and,

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>x\in I</m> and for all <m>r\in R</m>,
              <m>xr\in I</m> and <m>rx\in I</m>.

  <p>
    Observe that the third requirement for a set <m>I</m> to be an ideal 
    of <m>R</m> is simplified slightly if <m>R</m> is commutative. Namely, we 
    need only check one of the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many important examples and types of ideals,
    but there are also some trivial ideals contained in every ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring. Then <m>R</m> and <m>\{0\}</m> are ideals of <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Note that <m>R\subseteq R</m> is a subset of <m>R</m> containing 0, closed under addition, and closed under multiplication. 
        Therefore <m>R</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zero ideal <m>\{0\}</m> has <m>0</m>. The only element in <m>\{0\}</m> is <m>0</m> and <m>0+0=0\in \{0\}</m>. 
        Lastly, for any <m>r\in R</m>, we know <m>r\cdot 0 = 0</m> so that <m>r\cdot 0\in \{0\}</m>. Thus 
        <m>\{0\}</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  
  <p>
    The following theorem provides a useful characterization of when an ideal <m>I</m> is in fact the whole ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        Then <m>I = R</m> if and only if <m>I</m> contains a unit of 
        <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>I = R</m>, <m>1\in R</m> will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that <m>I\subseteq R</m>. If there is a unit <m>u\in I</m>, then given any <m>r\in R</m>,
      <m>r = r u^{-1} u = (ru^{-1}) u \in I</m>, so that <m>R \subseteq I</m> and hence <m>I=R</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ssec_idealsFromReductionModuloM">
  <title>Ideals from Reduction Modulo m</title>
  <p>
    We now illustrate how ideals and kernels are related by revisiting
    <xref ref="sec_integersModuloM"/>.
  </p>

  <proposition xml:id="prop_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Pick <m>m\in\mathbb{N}</m> with <m>m>1</m>. Then the reduction modulo <m>m</m> map
        <me>\varphi\colon \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/m</me>
        is a ring homomorphism with kernel given by 
        <me>m\mathbb{Z} = \{mk\mid k\in\mathbb{Z}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that <m>\varphi</m> satisfies <xref ref="def_ringHomomorphism"/>. To that end we first 
        show it is compatible with addition. Take <m>a,b\in\Z</m>. Then:
        <me>\varphi(a+b) = \overline{a+b} = \bar{a}+\bar{b} = \varphi(a)+\varphi(b).</me>
        But this is of course just the definition of addition in <m>\Z/m</m> which is why we spent so long 
        checking that addition was well-defined. We were really proving this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, for multiplication:
        <me>\varphi(ab) = \overline{ab} = \bar{a}\bar{b} = \varphi(a)\varphi(b).</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have <m>\varphi(0) = \bar{0}</m> and so <m>\varphi</m> satisfies all three propertis of being a ring homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, suppose <m>\varphi(a) = \bar{0}</m>. That is, <m>a\in\ker\vaprhi</m>. Then <m>\bar{a} = \bar{0}</m>. 
        But <m>\bar{0} = m\Z</m> and so <m>\bar{a} = m\Z</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>

  By <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal" /> we know that <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal. We could have; however, proved this directly. 
  We do this now as a prelude to the more general result in

<subsection xml:id="ssec_principalIdeals">
  <title>Principal Ideals</title>
  <p>
    The most important type of ideals (for our work, at least),
    are those which are the sets of all multiples of a single element 
    in the ring. Such ideals are called <em>principal ideals</em>.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>a\in R</m>.
        The set
        <me>
          (a) = \{ra\mid r\in R\}
        </me>
        is an ideal (called the <em>principal ideal generated by <m>a</m></em>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = 0\cdot a \in (a)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if <m>r_1 a, r_2 a\in (a)</m>,
      <m>r_1 a - r_2 a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in (a)</m>.
      Finally, if <m>x\in R</m> and <m>r a\in (a)</m>,
      <m>x (ra) = (xr) a \in (a)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>(a)</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The element <m>a</m> in the theorem is known as a
    <em>generator</em> of <m>(a)</m>.
  </p>
  <investigation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity, and let <m>x,y,z\in R</m>.
        Give necessary and sufficient conditions for <m>z\in (x)</m> and,
        separately,
        <m>(x) \subseteq (y)</m>.

        That is, fill in the blanks:
        <q><m>z\in (x) \Leftrightarrow</m> _________</q>

    <answer>

        We have

        and
        <q><m>(x)\subseteq (y) \Leftrightarrow y|x</m></q><fn>
        An acceptable alternative would be:
        <m>x\in (y)</m>.
        Make sure students are aware of this!
        </fn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <m>z\in (x) \Leftrightarrow \exists r\in R, z = xr \Leftrightarrow x|z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, suppose <m>(x)\subseteq (y)</m>.
        Then <m>x\in (y)</m>, so <m>y|x</m>.
        Conversely, if <m>y|x</m>,
        then there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>x = yr</m>,
        and thus for all <m>ax\in (x)</m>,
        <m>ax = (ar)y \in (y)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this means that if we want to know if <m>(x)\subseteq (y)</m>,
        it's enough to check that <m>x\in (y)</m>.
