  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
      of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
      This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects. Thus, in linear algebra,
      we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em> of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
      or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
      (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
      In real analysis and topology, the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
      and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration 
      of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important 
      class of subsets which will be integral to our understanding of 
      factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These subsets are called <em>ideals</em>. They arose in the work 
      of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of 
      unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the 
      fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

  We first return to the kernel of a ring homomorphism introduced in <xref ref="ssec_kernelOfAHomomorphism"/>. While the following proposition might seem odd, 
  it will lead us to the definition of an ideal.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop_kernelIsIdeal">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a ring homomorphism and <m>\ker\varphi</m> be its kernel. For any <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x,y\in \ker\varphi</m>, we have:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>rx\in\ker\varphi</m> and <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Pick <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=0</m>. Then 
      <me>\varphi(rx) = \varphi(r)\varphi(x) = \varphi(r)\cdot 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>rx\in \ker\varphi</m>. The proof of <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m> is similar 
      and is left as an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second claim, take <m>x,y\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=\varphi(y)=0</m>. Then 
      we have
      <me>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x)+\varphi(y) = 0 + 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</proposition>

<activity>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Mimic the proof of <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal"/> to show that whenever 
      <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism and <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in \ker\varphi</m>, then 
      <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m>

    The following definition of an <em>ideal</em> is an attempt to generalize 
    the properties that kernels have.

    <title>Two-Sided Ideals</title>

      Our definition is that of a two-sided ideal. There are left and right ideals; however, 
      we will not need this generality.

    Observe that the third requirement for a set <m>I</m> to be an ideal 
    of <m>R</m> is simplified slightly if <m>R</m> is commutative. Namely, we 
    need only check one of the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many important examples and types of ideals,
    but there are also some trivial ideals contained in every ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring. Then <m>R</m> and <m>\{0\}</m> are ideals of <m>R</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Note that <m>R\subseteq R</m> is a subset of <m>R</m> containing 0, closed under addition, and closed under multiplication. 
        Therefore <m>R</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zero ideal <m>\{0\}</m> has <m>0</m>. The only element in <m>\{0\}</m> is <m>0</m> and <m>0+0=0\in \{0\}</m>. 
        Lastly, for any <m>r\in R</m>, we know <m>r\cdot 0 = 0</m> so that <m>r\cdot 0\in \{0\}</m>. Thus 
        <m>\{0\}</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
      </p>

    <idx><h>ideal (proper)</h></idx>
    <idx><h>ideal (trivial)</h></idx>
    <idx><h>ideal (non-trivial)</h></idx>
    An ideal <m>I\subseteq R</m> is called <term>proper</term> if <m>I\neq R</m>. The ideals 
    <m>\{0\},R</m> are called <term>trivial ideals</term>. 
    If <m>I\subseteq R</m> is not equal to <m>\{0\},R</m>, it is called <term>non-trivial</term>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following theorem provides a useful characterization of when an ideal <m>I</m> is in fact the whole ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        Then <m>I = R</m> if and only if <m>I</m> contains a unit of 
        <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>I = R</m>, <m>1\in R</m> will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that <m>I\subseteq R</m>. If there is a unit <m>u\in I</m>, then given any <m>r\in R</m>,
      <m>r = r u^{-1} u = (ru^{-1}) u \in I</m>, so that <m>R \subseteq I</m> and hence <m>I=R</m>.

<subsection xml:id="ssec_examplesOfIdeals">
  <title>Ideals of the Integers Modulo m</title>
  <p>
    We collect some examples of ideals. Let's first investigate the relationship between <m>\Z</m> and <m>\Z/m</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Pick <m>m\in\mathbb{N}</m> with <m>m>1</m>. Then the reduction modulo <m>m</m> map
        <me>\varphi\colon \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/m</me>
        is a ring homomorphism with kernel given by 
        <me>m\mathbb{Z} = \{mk\mid k\in\mathbb{Z}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that <m>\varphi</m> satisfies <xref ref="def_ringHomomorphism"/>. To that end we first 
        show it is compatible with addition. Take <m>a,b\in\Z</m>. Then:
        <me>\varphi(a+b) = \overline{a+b} = \bar{a}+\bar{b} = \varphi(a)+\varphi(b).</me>
        But this is of course just the definition of addition in <m>\Z/m</m> which is why we spent so long 
        checking that addition was well-defined. We were really proving this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, for multiplication:
        <me>\varphi(ab) = \overline{ab} = \bar{a}\bar{b} = \varphi(a)\varphi(b).</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have <m>\varphi(0) = \bar{0}</m> and so <m>\varphi</m> satisfies all three propertis of being a ring homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, suppose <m>\varphi(a) = \bar{0}</m>. That is, <m>a\in\ker\vaprhi</m>. Then <m>\bar{a} = \bar{0}</m>. 
        But <m>\bar{0} = m\Z</m> and so <m>\bar{a} = m\Z</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    By <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal" /> we know that <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal. We could have proved this directly. 
    We do this now as it is an important skill to develop.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_idealsInZ">
    <title>Multiples of <m>m</m> in <m>\Z</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Fix any <m>m\in\Z</m>, then the set of multiples of <m>m</m> is an ideal. That is, <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal. We prove this 
        directly from the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have <m>0 = m\cdot 0\in\Z</m>. For closure under addition, take <m>mk, ml\in m\Z</m> for some <m>k,l\in\Z</m>. Then 
        <me>mk + ml = m(k+l)\in m\Z</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\Z</m> is commutative, we just have to show <m>m\Z</m> absorbs left-multiplication. For that, take <m>mk\in m\Z</m> and 
        arbitrary <m>a\in\Z</m>. Then 
        <me>a(mk) = m(ak)\in \Z.</me>
        Thus we have reproved <xref ref="thm_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism"/>: <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal of <m>\Z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>m=0</m>, then <m>0\Z = \{0\}</m> is the zero ideal. If <m>m=\pm 1</m>, then <m>m\Z = \Z</m> is the other extreme. For <m>|m|>1</m>, 
        the ideals <m>m\Z</m> are proper.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="ex_matrixRingsAreSimple">
    <title>Matrix Rings are Simple</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's consider our non-commutative example: <m>M_2(\R)</m>. What are the ideals here? It turns out, that this ring is <em>simple</em> in that it 
        only has trivial ideals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall, the standard basis for <m>M_2(\R)</m> consists of the sparse matrices <m>e_{ij}</m> which have a <m>1</m> in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> and zero 
        elsewhere. For any matrix <m>A = (a_{ij})</m> we have:
        <me>e_{11}\cdot \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} \amp a_{12} \\ a_{21} \amp a_{22}\end{bmatrix}e_{11} = \begin{bmatrix}  a_{11}\amp 0\\ 0 \amp 0\end{bmatrix}</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly <m>e_{12}\cdot A e_{12}</m> is the matrix with <m>a_{12}</m> in the <m>(1,2)</m> entry and zero elsewhere. Likewise for <m>e_{21}\cdot A\cdot e_{21}</m> 
        and <m>e_{22}\cdot A\cdot e_{22}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now take any ideal <m>I\subseteq M_2(\R)</m>. We know that <m>\{0\}, M_2(\R)</m> are two ideals. What we want to show is that if <m>I\neq \{0\}</m>, then 
        <m>I=M_2(\R)</m>. To that end, suppose <m>I\neq\{0\}</m> so there is a non-zero <m>A\in I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least one of the entries of <m>A</m> is non-zero, say <m>a_{i,j}\neq 0</m>. Then <m>e_{ij}\cdot A\cdot e_{ij}\in I</m> is the matrix with <m>a_{ij}</m>
        in the <m>(i,j)</m> spot and zero elsehwere. Multiply by the scalar matrix <m>\frac{1}{a_{ij}}</m> so that we know <m>I</m> has a matrix with <m>1</m> in exactly 
        one entry and zero elsewhere. That is, we know that one of the standard basis elements is in <m>I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show that if one of the standard basis elements is in <m>I</m>, then <m>I</m> has all of the standard basis elements. The proof for each case is similar so we assume that 
        <m>I</m> has <m>e_{11} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Since <m>I</m> absorbs multiplication, every product we compute will be an 
        element of <m>I</m>. We have: 
        <me>e_{11}\cdot e_{12} = e_{12}\in I.</me>
        and
        <me>\begin{bmatrix} 0 \amp 1 \\ 1 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}\cdot e_{12} = e_{22}\in I</me>
        and lastly <m>e_{22}\cdot e_{12} = e_{12}\in I</m>. Thus <m>I</m> has all of the elements in the standard basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see now that <m>I</m> has any matrix, we take a random <m>B = (b_{ij})</m>. We can write
        <me>B = b_{11}I_2\cdot e_{11} + b_{12}I\cdot e_{12} + b_{21}I\cdot e_{21} + b_{22}I\cdot e_{22}</me>
        Each one of the terms in this sum is in <m>I</m> since <m>I</m> absorbs multiplication. Since <m>I</m> is closed under 
        addition, <m>B\in I</m>. But <m>B</m> was arbitrary so that <m>I = M_2(\R)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, more is true! For any field <m>\mathbb{F}</m> and any <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, the ring <m>M_n(\mathbb{F})</m> of <m>n\times n</m> matrices over <m>\mathbb{F}</m> is a 
        simple ring. That is, it has no non-trivial ideals. The proof is similar to the case <m>n=2</m> and <m>\mathbb{F} = \R</m>: the field was irrelevant in our work and we use the 
        matrices <m>e_{ij}</m> and their multiplication rules to show that we get all of <m>M_n(\mathbb{R})</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <title>Central Elements</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex_kernelEvaluation0"/>, to show closure under multiplication by <m>R</m>, we used that for 
      any polynomial <m>r(x)\in R[x]</m> we have <m>r(x)\cdot x = x\cdot r(x)</m>. If <m>R</m> is not commutative, then <m>R[x]</m> 
      is also non-commutative. However, <m>x</m> is a <em>central element</em> of <m>R[x]</m>. Namely, <m>x</m> commutes with all polynomials.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <example xml:id="ex_kernelEvaluation0">
    <title>Polynomials Without Constant Term</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's now consider the polynomial ring <m>R[x]</m> over a genral ring <m>R</m> in the indeterminant <m>x</m>. Let <m>I\subseteq R[x]</m> 
        be the collection of all polynomials without constant term:
        <me>
          I = \{a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\cdots + a_nx^n\mid a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n\in R\}.
        </me>
        Let us check that <m>I</m> is an ideal. Before that, let us notice that if <m>p(x)\in I</m> then the lack of a constant term allows us to factor out an <m>x</m>. 
        So there is some <m>q(x)</m> such that <m>p(x) = xq(x)</m>. Explicitly:
        <md>
          <mrow>p(x) \amp=a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\cdots + a_nx^n </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=x(a_1+a_2x+a_3x^2+\cdots + a_nx^{n-1}) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp=xq(x) </mrow>
        </md>
        where we set <m>q(x) = a_1+a_2x+a_3x^2+\cdots + a_nx^{n-1}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zero polynomial has zero as a constant term so <m>0\in I</m>. Suppose we add two polynomials without constant term (possibly extend by zero so degrees match):
        <md>
          <mrow>p(x) \amp= a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n</mrow>
          <mrow>q(x) \amp= b_1x+\cdots + b_nx^n</mrow>
          <mrow>p(x)+q(x) \amp= (a_1+b_1)x+\cdots + (a_n+b_n)x^n </mrow>
        </md>
        and their sum also has no constant term. Alternatively, there exists polynomials <m>p'(x),q'(x)\in R[x]</m> such that <m>p(x) = xp'(x)</m> and <m>q(x) = xq'(x)</m>. Hence, 
        <me>
          p(x) + q(x) = xp'(x) + xq'(x) = x(p'(x)+q'(x))
        </me>
        also has no constant term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose we have a polynomial without a constant term with a general polynomial, so <m>p(x)\in I</m> and <m>r(x)\in R[x]</m>. Then there is <m>p'(x)\in R[x]</m> 
        with <m>p(x) = xp'(x)</m>. Hence, 
        <me>
          r(x)p(x) = r(x)xp'(x) = x(r(x)p'(x))
        </me>
        and so the product lacks a constant term. We conclude that the polynomials without constant term collectively form an ideal <m>I</m> in <m>R[x]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show that, at least in the commutative case, this ideal is the kernel of a familiar homomorphism. It is true in the non-commutative case 
        as well but some care needs to be taken as the evaluation homomorphism from <xref ref="exer_evaluationHomomorphismGeneralR"/> is ill-behaved 
        when <m>R</m> is non-commutative. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>R</m> is commutative and let us consider the evaluation homomorphism 
        <me>
          \mathrm{ev}_{0_R}\colon R[x]\to R\text{ given by }\mathrm{ev}_0(p(x)) = p(0).
        </me>
        From <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal"/>, the kernel of this homomorphism, <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_0</m> is an ideal. We claim that it is precisely the ideal 
        of polynomials without constant term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\mathrm{ev}_{0_R}(p(x)) = 0</m> or equivalently <m>p(0_R) = 0_R</m>. Writing <m>p(x) = a_0+a_1x+\cdots +a_nx^n</m> we have
        <md>
          <mrow>0_R \amp=p(0_R) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= a_0 + a_1\cdot 0_R+\cdots + a_n\cdot 0_R^n </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= a_0 </mrow>
        </md>
        and so <m>a_0=0</m>. That is to say, the condition that <m>p(x)\in \ker\mathrm{ev}_{0_R}</m> is precisely the condition that <m>p(x)</m> has no 
        constant term. Hence, <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_{0_R} = I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example shows that the ideal we defined is in fact a kernel of a homomorphism. This is a general fact that will lead us to the construction of 
        <term>quotient rings</term>.

    are those which are the sets of all multiples of a single element
    in the ring. We saw this with <m>m\Z\subseteq \Z</m>. Such 
    ideals are called <em>principal ideals</em>.

  <p>
    For the following theorem/definition, we require commutative rings. The interested reader
    is invited to formalize a definition for non-commutative rings.

        <description>Principal Ideal Generated by <m>a</m></description>
        </notation>

        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and let <m>a\in R</m>.
        The set
        <me>
          (a) = \{ra\mid r\in R\}
        </me>
        is an ideal (called the <term>principal ideal generated by <m>a</m></term>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = 0\cdot a \in (a)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if <m>r_1 a, r_2 a\in (a)</m>,
      <m>r_1 a - r_2 a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in (a)</m>.
      Finally, if <m>x\in R</m> and <m>r a\in (a)</m>,
      <m>x (ra) = (xr) a \in (a)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>(a)</m> is an ideal.

    The element <m>a</m> in the theorem is known as a

      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, suppose <m>(x)\subseteq (y)</m>.
        Then <m>x\in (y)</m>, so <m>y|x</m>.
        Conversely, if <m>y|x</m>,
        then there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>x = yr</m>,

        <m>ax = (ar)y \in (y)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this means that if we want to know if <m>(x)\subseteq (y)</m>,

  <title>Ideals Generated by a Set</title>
  <p>
    A good chunk of rings of interest are infinite and so their ideals are also usually infinite. We saw that in some cases
    ideals can be described by a single element, a principal generator. Rings where ideals are always generated by a single element
    are called <term>principal ideal rings</term>. These will be the subject of the next section.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to understand what happens when you cannot 
    generate the whole ideal with a single element. We introduce ideals generated by finitely many elements now.
    When ideals of a ring <m>R</m> are always guaranteed to be generated by finitely many elements the ring is called <term>Noetherian rings</term>.

          (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) = \{r_1a_1+r_2a_2+\cdots + r_na_n\mid r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\in R\}.
        </me> 
      </p>
    </statement>

  <p>
    Let's verify it is an ideal.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_idealGeneratedByFinitelyManyElementsIsIdeal">
    <statement>

        Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring and <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in R</m>. Then <m>(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)</m> is an ideal.

      <p>
        Set <m>I = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)</m>. Then

    <title>A Non-Principal Ideal</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Take <m>(2,x)\subseteq\Z[x]</m>. We claim that <m>(2,x)</m> cannot be generated by a single element. 
        Indeed, suppose <m>(2,x) = (f(x))</m> for some polynomial <m>f(x)\in\Z[x]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>2 = 1\cdot 2 + 0\cdot x\in (2,x)</m>, we know that <m>2\in (f(x))</m>. Hence, <m>2 = f(x)\cdot q(x)</m> for some 
        polynomial <m>q(x)</m>. By comparing degrees, <m>\deg(f(x)) = 0</m>. In particular, <m>f(x)</m> is a constant that is divides <m>2</m>.
        This means that <m>f(x) = \pm 1</m> or <m>\pm 2</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It cannot be that <m>f(x) = \pm 1</m> (Exercise???). There will be an easier way to prove this when we learn the Noether Isomorphism Theorem.
        It follows then that <m>f(x) = \pm 2</m>. This means that <m>(2,x) = (2)</m>. But this is impossible. Indeed, notice that <m>x\in (2,x) = (2)</m> but every element 
        of <m>(2)</m> has even coefficients. This contradiction shows that <m>(2,x)</m> is not a principal ideal. In particular, <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a principal
        ideal domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    It turns out that any ideal in <m>\Z[x]</m> can be generated by at most two elements. The proof of this is beyond the scope of this textbook.
