  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the ways in which mathematicians study the <em>structure</em>
      of an abstract object is by considering how it interacts with other (related) objects.
      This is especially true of its <em>sub</em>objects. Thus, in linear algebra,
      we are often concerned with <em>subspaces</em> of a vector space as a means of understanding the vector space,
      or even submatrices as a way of understanding a matrix
      (see, e.g., the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant).
      In real analysis and topology, the important subobjects are usually open sets, or subsequences,
      and the study of a graph's subgraphs is an important approach to many questions in graph theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we begin a set-theoretic structural exploration 
      of the notion of ring by considering a particularly important 
      class of subsets which will be integral to our understanding of 
      factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These subsets are called <em>ideals</em>. They arose in the work 
      of Kummer and Dedekind as a way of trying to recover some notion of 
      unique factorization in rings that do not have properties like the 
      fundamental theorem of arithmetic in <m>\Z</m>.

  We first return to the kernel of a ring homomorphism introduced in <xref ref="ssec_kernelOfAHomomorphism"/>. While the following proposition might seem odd, 
  it will lead us to the definition of an ideal.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop_kernelIsIdeal">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a ring homomorphism and <m>\ker\varphi</m> be its kernel. For any <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x,y\in \ker\varphi</m>, we have:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>rx\in\ker\varphi</m> and <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Pick <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=0</m>. Then 
      <me>\varphi(rx) = \varphi(r)\varphi(x) = \varphi(r)\cdot 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>rx\in \ker\varphi</m>. The proof of <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m> is similar 
      and is left as an activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second claim, take <m>x,y\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=\varphi(y)=0</m>. Then 
      we have
      <me>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x)+\varphi(y) = 0 + 0 = 0.</me>
      Thus <m>x+y\in\ker\varphi</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</proposition>

<activity>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Mimic the proof of <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal"/> to show that whenever 
      <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism and <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in \ker\varphi</m>, then 
      <m>xr\in\ker\varphi</m>

    The following definition of an <em>ideal</em> is an attempt to generalize 
    the properties that kernels have.

    <title>Two-Sided Ideals</title>
    <p>
      Our definition is that of a two-sided ideal. There are left and right ideals; however, 
      we will not need this generality.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>I</m> of a (not necessarily commutative) ring <m>R</m> is called an <term>ideal</term> if:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>0\in I</m>

  <p>
    Observe that the third requirement for a set <m>I</m> to be an ideal 
    of <m>R</m> is simplified slightly if <m>R</m> is commutative. Namely, we 
    need only check one of the conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many important examples and types of ideals,
    but there are also some trivial ideals contained in every ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring. Then <m>R</m> and <m>\{0\}</m> are ideals of <m>R</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Note that <m>R\subseteq R</m> is a subset of <m>R</m> containing 0, closed under addition, and closed under multiplication. 
        Therefore <m>R</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zero ideal <m>\{0\}</m> has <m>0</m>. The only element in <m>\{0\}</m> is <m>0</m> and <m>0+0=0\in \{0\}</m>. 
        Lastly, for any <m>r\in R</m>, we know <m>r\cdot 0 = 0</m> so that <m>r\cdot 0\in \{0\}</m>. Thus 
        <m>\{0\}</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>.
      </p>

    <idx><h>ideal (proper)</h></idx>
    <idx><h>ideal (trivial)</h></idx>
    <idx><h>ideal (non-trivial)</h></idx>
    An ideal <m>I\subseteq R</m> is called <term>proper</term> if <m>I\neq R</m>. The ideals 
    <m>\{0\},R</m> are called <term>trivial ideals</term>. 
    If <m>I\subseteq R</m> is not equal to <m>\{0\},R</m>, it is called <term>non-trivial</term>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following theorem provides a useful characterization of when an ideal <m>I</m> is in fact the whole ring.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
        Then <m>I = R</m> if and only if <m>I</m> contains a unit of 
        <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>I = R</m>, <m>1\in R</m> will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that <m>I\subseteq R</m>. If there is a unit <m>u\in I</m>, then given any <m>r\in R</m>,
      <m>r = r u^{-1} u = (ru^{-1}) u \in I</m>, so that <m>R \subseteq I</m> and hence <m>I=R</m>.

<subsection xml:id="ssec_examplesOfIdeals">
  <title>Ideals of the Integers Modulo m</title>
  <p>
    We collect some examples of ideals. Let's first investigate the relationship between <m>\Z</m> and <m>\Z/m</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Pick <m>m\in\mathbb{N}</m> with <m>m>1</m>. Then the reduction modulo <m>m</m> map
        <me>\varphi\colon \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/m</me>
        is a ring homomorphism with kernel given by 
        <me>m\mathbb{Z} = \{mk\mid k\in\mathbb{Z}\}.</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We need to show that <m>\varphi</m> satisfies <xref ref="def_ringHomomorphism"/>. To that end we first 
        show it is compatible with addition. Take <m>a,b\in\Z</m>. Then:
        <me>\varphi(a+b) = \overline{a+b} = \bar{a}+\bar{b} = \varphi(a)+\varphi(b).</me>
        But this is of course just the definition of addition in <m>\Z/m</m> which is why we spent so long 
        checking that addition was well-defined. We were really proving this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, for multiplication:
        <me>\varphi(ab) = \overline{ab} = \bar{a}\bar{b} = \varphi(a)\varphi(b).</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have <m>\varphi(0) = \bar{0}</m> and so <m>\varphi</m> satisfies all three propertis of being a ring homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, suppose <m>\varphi(a) = \bar{0}</m>. That is, <m>a\in\ker\vaprhi</m>. Then <m>\bar{a} = \bar{0}</m>. 
        But <m>\bar{0} = m\Z</m> and so <m>\bar{a} = m\Z</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    By <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal" /> we know that <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal. We could have proved this directly. 
    We do this now as it is an important skill to develop.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Fix any <m>m\in\Z</m>, then the set of multiples of <m>m</m> is an ideal. That is, <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal. We prove this 
        directly from the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have <m>0 = m\cdot 0\in\Z</m>. For closure under addition, take <m>mk, ml\in m\Z</m> for some <m>k,l\in\Z</m>. Then 
        <me>mk + ml = m(k+l)\in m\Z</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\Z</m> is commutative, we just have to show <m>m\Z</m> absorbs left-multiplication. For that, take <m>mk\in m\Z</m> and 
        arbitrary <m>a\in\Z</m>. Then 
        <me>a(mk) = m(ak)\in \Z.</me>
        Thus we have reproved <xref ref="thm_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism"/>: <m>m\Z</m> is an ideal of <m>\Z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>m=0</m>, then <m>0\Z = \{0\}</m> is the zero ideal. If <m>m=\pm 1</m>, then <m>m\Z = \Z</m> is the other extreme. For <m>|m|>1</m>, 
        the ideals <m>m\Z</m> are proper.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's consider our non-commutative example: <m>M_2(\R)</m>. What are the ideals here? It turns out, that this ring is <em>simple</em> in that it 
        only has trivial ideals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall, the standard basis for <m>M_2(\R)</m> consists of the sparse matrices <m>e_{ij}</m> which have a <m>1</m> in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> and zero 
        elsewhere. For any matrix <m>A = (a_{ij})</m> we have:
        <me>e_{11}\cdot \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} \amp a_{12} \\ a_{21} \amp a_{22}\end{bmatrix}e_{11} = \begin{bmatrix}  a_{11}\amp 0\\ 0 \amp 0\end{bmatrix}</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly <m>e_{12}\cdot A e_{12}</m> is the matrix with <m>a_{12}</m> in the <m>(1,2)</m> entry and zero elsewhere. Likewise for <m>e_{21}\cdot A\cdot e_{21}</m> 
        and <m>e_{22}\cdot A\cdot e_{22}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now take any ideal <m>I\subseteq M_2(\R)</m>. We know that <m>\{0\}, M_2(\R)</m> are two ideals. What we want to show is that if <m>I\neq \{0\}</m>, then 
        <m>I=M_2(\R)</m>. To that end, suppose <m>I\neq\{0\}</m> so there is a non-zero <m>A\in I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least one of the entries of <m>A</m> is non-zero, say <m>a_{i,j}\neq 0</m>. Then <m>e_{ij}\cdot A\cdot e_{ij}\in I</m> is the matrix with <m>a_{ij}</m>
        in the <m>(i,j)</m> spot and zero elsehwere. Multiply by the scalar matrix <m>\frac{1}{a_{ij}}</m> so that we know <m>I</m> has a matrix with <m>1</m> in exactly 
        one entry and zero elsewhere. That is, we know that one of the standard basis elements is in <m>I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now show that if one of the standard basis elements is in <m>I</m>, then <m>I</m> has all of the standard basis elements. The proof for each case is similar so we assume that 
        <m>I</m> has <m>e_{11} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Since <m>I</m> absorbs multiplication, every product we compute will be an 
        element of <m>I</m>. We have: 
        <me>e_{11}\cdot e_{12} = e_{12}\in I.</me>
        and
        <me>\begin{bmatrix} 0 \amp 1 \\ 1 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}\cdot e_{12} = e_{22}\in I</me>
        and lastly <m>e_{22}\cdot e_{12} = e_{12}\in I</m>. Thus <m>I</m> has all of the elements in the standard basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see now that <m>I</m> has any matrix, we take a random <m>B = (b_{ij})</m>. We can write
        <me>B = b_{11}I_2\cdot e_{11} + b_{12}I\cdot e_{12} + b_{21}I\cdot e_{21} + b_{22}I\cdot e_{22}</me>
        Each one of the terms in this sum is in <m>I</m> since <m>I</m> absorbs multiplication. Since <m>I</m> is closed under 
        addition, <m>B\in I</m>. But <m>B</m> was arbitrary so that <m>I = M_2(\R)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's now consider the polynomial ring over <m>\C</m>: <m>\C[x]</m>. Define the homomorphism 
        <m>\mathrm{ev}_0\colon\C[x]\to \C</m> given by <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(p(x)) = p(0)</m>. We've already see that 
        <m>\mathrm{ev}_0</m> is a homomorphism. From <xref ref="prop_kernelIsIdeal"/>, the kernel of this mapping is an ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(p(x)) = 0</m> or equivalently <m>p(0) = 0</m>. We will revisit evaluation later but for now 
        recall that this means that <m>x</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>. That is, there exists <m>p'(x)</m> such that 
        <m>p(x) = xp'(x)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, suppose <m>f(x)\in\C[x]</m>, then <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(xf(x)) = 0f(0) = 0</m>. We can therefore describe 
        the kernel of the multiplication map as the multiples of <m>x</m>:
        <me>\ker\mathrm{ev}_0 = x\C[x] = \{xp(x)\mid p(x)\in \C[x]\}.</me>

  <title>Ideals Generated by a Set</title>
  <p>
    A good chunk of rings of interest are infinite and so their ideals are also usually infinite. We saw that in some cases
    ideals can be described by a single element, a principal generator. Ideals that are always generated by a single elements 
    are called <term>principal ideal rings</term>. We will return to those later when we discuss factorization in general rings. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we will primarily focus on such principal ideal rings. It is important to understand what happens when you cannot 
    generate the whole ideal with a single element. We introduce ideals generated by finitel many elements now.
    Note, ideals that are always guaranteed to be generated by finitely many elements are called <term>Noetherian rings</term>.

      <description>Ideal Generated by <m>a_1,\ldots,a_n</m></description>
    </notation>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in R</m>. The <term>ideal generated by</term> <m>a_1,\ldots,a_n</m> is the subset:
        <me>
          (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n) = \{r_1a_1+r_2a_2+\cdots + r_na_n\mid r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\in R\}.
        </me> 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Let's verify it is an ideal.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_idealGeneratedByFinitelyManyElementsIsIdeal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>R</m> is a commutative ring and <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\in R</m>. Then <m>(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Set <m>I = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)</m>. Then 
        <me>0 = 0\cdot a_1 + \cdots + 0\cdot a_n \in I.</me>

        For closure under addition:
        <md>
          <mrow> \amp (a_1r_1+\cdots + a_nr_n) + (b_1r_1+\cdots +b_nr_n)</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= (a_1+b_1)r_1 + \cdots + (a_n+b_n)r_n </mrow> 
        </md>
        which is in <m>I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For closure under left-multiplication:
        <me>
          r(r_1a_1+\cdots + r_na_n) = (rr_1)a_1 + \cdots + (rr_n)a_n
        </me>
        which is in <m>I</m>. We conclude that <m>I</m> is an ideal.

  <example xml:id="ex_nonPrincipalIdeal">
    <title>A Non-Principal Ideal</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Take <m>(2,x)\subseteq\Z[x]</m>. We claim that <m>(2,x)</m> cannot be generated by a single element. 
        Indeed, suppose <m>(2,x) = (f(x))</m> for some polynomial <m>f(x)\in\Z[x]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>2 = 1\cdot 2 + 0\cdot x\in (2,x)</m>, we know that <m>2\in (f(x))</m>. Hence, <m>2 = f(x)\cdot q(x)</m> for some 
        polynomial <m>q(x)</m>. By comparing degrees, <m>\deg(f(x)) = 0</m>. In particular, <m>f(x)</m> is a constant that is divides <m>2</m>.
        This means that <m>f(x) = \pm 1</m> or <m>\pm 2</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It cannot be that <m>f(x) = \pm 1</m> (Exercise???). There will be an easier way to prove this when we learn the Noether Isomorphism Theorem.
        It follows then that <m>f(x) = \pm 2</m>. This means that <m>(2,x) = (2)</m>. But this is impossible. Indeed, notice that <m>x\in (2,x) = (2)</m> but every element 
        of <m>(2)</m> has even coefficients. This contradiction shows that <m>(2,x)</m> is not a principal ideal. In particular, <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a principal
        ideal domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    It turns out that any ideal in <m>\Z[x]</m> can be generated by at most two elements. The proof of this is beyond the scope of this textbook.
