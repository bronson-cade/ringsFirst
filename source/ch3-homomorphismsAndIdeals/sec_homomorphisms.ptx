      Central to modern mathematics is the notion of <em>function</em><fn>. This section assumes a familiarity with the idea of function from a set-theoretic 
      point of view, as well as the concepts of injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective functions (one-to-one correspondences).</fn>.
      Functions arise in all areas of mathematics, each subdiscipline concerned with certain types of functions.
      In algebra, our concern is with <em>operation-preserving</em> functions, such as the linear transformations <m>L : V\to W</m> of vector spaces you have seen in a course in linear algebra.
      Those linear transformations had the properties that <m>L(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) = L(\mathbf{v})+L(\mathbf{u})</m> (addition is preserved) and <m>L(c\mathbf{u}) = c L(\mathbf{u})</m> (scalar multiplication is preserved).

    We find something similar at work in the study of homomorphisms of rings, which we define to be 
    functions that preserve both addition and multiplication.

        Let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be rings. A function <m>\varphi : R\to S</m> is called a
        <term>ring homomorphism</term>
        if it preserves addition, multiplication, and sends the identity of <m>R</m> to the identity of <m>S</m>.
        That is, for all <m>x,y\in R</m>:

          <li><m>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)</m>,</li>

        we say that <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>epimorphism</term>. If <m>\varphi</m> is a bijection (both injective and surjective), we say that <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>isomorphism</term>
        and write <m>R\cong S</m>.

          it fails the other two properties of a ring homorphism in general (sometimes not though!). Namely, for a general ring <m>1_R\neq -1_R</m> so that <m>\psi(1_R) = -1_R\neq 1_R</m> and also <m>\psi(xy) = -xy</m> but <m>\psi(x)\psi(y) = (-x)(-y) = xy</m>. In general, <m>xy\neq -xy</m> so <m>\psi</m> is not compatible with multiplication or unity. However, sometimes <m>-a = a</m> is true for every element of the ring, particularly Boolean rings. Examples include <m>\Z/2, \Z/2[x]</m>.

    <title>The Frobenius Homomorphism</title>
    <idx><h>Frobenius Homomorphism</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Frobenius Homomorphism (or just Frobenius) is a homomorphism
        that exists whenever we are working with a prime. In this example, we look at the 
        Frobenius on a polynomial ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>p</m> be a prime. Consider the function:
        <me>\mathrm{Fr}\colon \mathbb{F}_p[x]\to \mathbb{F}_p[x]</me>
        defined by <m>\mathrm{Fr}(f(x)) = (f(x))^p</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we prove that the Frobenius is a homomorphism, let's recall that whenever <m>k\neq 0,p</m> the 
        binomial coefficient <m>{p\choose k}</m> is divisible by <m>p</m>. Indeed, using the usual formula:
        <me>{p\choose k} = \frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!} = \frac{p(p-1)!}{(p-k)!k!}.</me>
        All of the terms in the denominator are strictly less than <m>p</m> provided <m>k\ne 0,p</m>. Thus there is no term 
        in the denominator that will cancel the <m>p</m> in the numerator. In particular, the binomial 
        coefficients <m>{p\choose k}</m> are <m>0</m> in <m>\mathbb{F}_p</m> whenever <m>k\ne 0,p</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that done, let's show <m>\mathrm{Fr}</m> is a homomorphism. It preserves unity: <m>\mathrm{Fr}(1) = 1^p = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For compatibility with addition, suppose <m>f(x),g(x)\in\mathbb{F}_2[x]</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp\mathrm{Fr}(f(x)+g(x)) </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= (f(x)+g(x))^p </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= f(x)^p +{p\choose 1}f(x)^{p-1}g(x) + \cdots + {p\choose p-1}f(x)g(x)^{p-1} + g(x)^p</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = f(x)^p + 0 + g(x)^p </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp = \mathrm{Fr}(f(x)) + \mathrm{Fr}(g(x)) </mrow>
        </md>
        as the cross terms are zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        For compatibility with multiplication:
        <me>\mathrm{Fr}(f(x)\cdot g(x)) = (f(x)\cdot g(x))^p = f(x)^p\cdot g(x)^p = \mathrm{Fr}(f(x))\cdot \mathrm{Fr}g(x).</me>
        We conclude that the Frobenius is a homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following checks will be left as an exercise: The Frobenius is a monomorphism, it is not an epimorphism, and hence not an automorphism.

        and so <m>y-x\in\ker\varphi</m>. Since the only element here is <m>0</m>, we conclude that <m>y-x=0</m> or that <m>y=x</m>. Thus <m>\varphi</m>

      A nice application of this theorem is the following result that shows that homomorphisms from a field are always monomorphisms. They will never fail to

          Suppose <m>\varphi\colon F\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism where <m>F</m> is a field. Then <m>\varphi</m> is a monomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\varphi\colon F\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism where <m>F</m> is a field. We show <m>\varphi</m> is a monomorphism by applying 
        <xref ref="thm_zeroKernelIsInto"/>. Suppose that there is <m>x\in F</m>, with <m>\varphi(x) = 0</m>. If <m>x\neq 0</m>, then  
        there <m>x</m> is a unit. By <xref ref="thm_homomorphismsPreserveUnits"/>, <m>\varphi(x)</m> is also a unit and in particular is not <m>0</m>. Thus

    The image of a homomorphism <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> is just different terminology for the range.

  <p>
    Before we prove that the image of a homomorphism is a subring, let's note that homomorphisms preserve 
    most ring-axioms. In particular, we have defined subtraction of two ring elements <m>a,b\in R</m> as <m>a-b:=a+(-b)</m>, 
    where <m>-b</m> is the additive inverse of <m>b</m>. In <xref ref="exer_homomorphismPreserveAdditiveInverse"/> you will 
    prove that homorphisms preserve additive inverses, namely: <m>\varphi(-r) =-\varphi(r)</m>. In particular,
    <me>\varphi(a)-\varphi(b) = \varphi(a)+\varphi(-b) = \varphi(a-b).</me>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_S</m>, we know that <m>1_S\in\mathrm{im}\varphi</m>. We just need to show it is closed under 
        subtraction and multiplication:

        For subtraction, take <m>\varphi(r_1),\varphi(r_2)\in\mathrm{im}\varphi</m>. Then

        For multiplication, we have 
        <me>\varphi(r_1)\cdot \varphi(r_2) = \varphi(r_1\cdot r_2)\in\mathrm{im}\varphi.</me>

    We now return to <m>\Z</m> and investigate homomorphisms <m>\varphi\colon \Z\to R</m>, where <m>R</m> is an arbitrary ring.
    We will prove that there is one and only one homomorphism. This shows that <m>\Z</m> is the <term>initial ring</term>. It is the
    unique ring (up to isomorphism) that has this property.

    define
    <me>
      n\cdot a = a + a + \cdots + a

        For any ring <m>R</m>, there is a unique homomorphism <m>\varphi\colon \Z\to R</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>\varphi\colon \Z\to R</m> be an arbitrary homomorphism. Since the image of unity 
        is unity we have <m>\varphi(1) = 1_R</m>. Since the image of the additive identity is the 
        additive identity, we have <m>\varphi(0) = 0_R</m>. By induction, we conclude that <m>\varphi(n) = n\cdot 1_R</m> 
        for any <m>n\in\N_0</m>. Similarly <m>\varphi(-n) = (-n)\cdot 1_R</m> for any <m>n\in\N</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\varphi</m> was arbitrary, we have seen that any homomorphism is the homomorphism <m>\varphi(a) = a\cdot 1_R</m>. This
