      Central to modern mathematics is the notion of <em>function</em><fn>. This section assumes a familiarity with the idea of function from a set-theoretic 
      point of view, as well as the concepts of injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective functions (one-to-one correspondences).</fn>.
      Functions arise in all areas of mathematics, each subdiscipline concerned with certain types of functions.
      In algebra, our concern is with <em>operation-preserving</em> functions, such as the linear transformations <m>L : V\to W</m> of vector spaces you have seen in a course in linear algebra.
      Those linear transformations had the properties that <m>L(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) = L(\mathbf{v})+L(\mathbf{u})</m> (addition is preserved) and <m>L(c\mathbf{u}) = c L(\mathbf{u})</m> (scalar multiplication is preserved).

    <title>Homomorphisms</title>

    We find something similar at work in the study of homomorphisms of rings, which we define to be 
    functions that preserve both addition and multiplication.

        Let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be rings. A function <m>\varphi : R\to S</m> is called a
        <term>ring homomorphism</term>
        if it preserves addition, multiplication, and sends the identity of <m>R</m> to the identity of <m>S</m>.
        That is, for all <m>x,y\in R</m>:
        <ul>
          <li><m>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)</m>,</li>
          <li><m>\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)</m>, and</li>
          <li><m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_S</m>.</li>
        </ul>
        If <m>\varphi</m> is injective (one-to-one), we say that <m>\varphi</m> is a <term>monomorphism</term>. If <m>\varphi</m> is surjective (onto), 
        we say that <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>epimorphism</term>. If <m>\varphi</m> is a bijection (both injective and surjective), we say that <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>isomorphism</term>
        and write <m>R\cong S</m>.
        If <m>\varphi : R\to R</m> is an isomorphism, we say <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>automorphism</term> of <m>R</m>.

        <li><m>\varphi\colon R\to R</m> defined by <m>\varphi(x)=x</m> is called the <term>identity mapping</term>. We in particular have:

          The identity mapping satisfies the criteria for being a ring homomorphism. It is an automorphism.

        <li>
          <m>\psi\colon R\to R</m> defined by <m>\psi(x)=-x</m> is the negation mapping. Although it is true that
          <me>\psi(x+y) = -(x+y) = -x+(-y)=\psi(x)+\psi(y)</me>
          it fails the other two properties of a ring homorphism in general (sometimes not though!). Namely, for a general ring <m>1_R\neq -1_R</m> so that <m>\psi(1_R) = -1_R\neq 1_R</m> and also <m>\psi(xy) = -xy</m> but <m>\psi(x)\psi(y) = (-x)(-y) = xy</m>. In general, <m>xy\neq -xy</m> so <m>\psi</m> is not compatible with multiplication or unity. However, sometimes <m>-a = a</m> is true for every element of the ring, particularly Boolean rings. Examples include <m>\Z/2, \Z/2[x]</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>\alpha\colon \Z\to \Z</m> defined by <m>\alpha(x)=5x</m>, or the multiplication by <m>5</m> map. The map <m>\alpha</m> does not preserve the unity nor does it preserve multiplication. Check! It is not a ring homomorphism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Fr\colon \Z_2[x]\to \Z_2[x]</m> defined by <m>Fr(p) = p^2</m> is sometimes called the Frobenius mapping. It is in fact a ring homomorphism in this case. For the unity and multiplicative compatibility we have 
          <m>Fr(1) = 1^2 = 1</m> and <m>Fr(pq) = (pq)^2 = p^2q^2=Fr(p)Fr(q)</m>. For compatibility with addition we remind the reader that <m>2\equiv_20</m>:
          <me>Fr(p+q) = (p+q)^2 = p^2+2pq+q^2 = p^2+q^2 = Fr(p)+Fr(q).</me>
          It is not an automorphism; however, it is a homomorphism. Homomorphisms from a ring to itself are called <term>endomorphisms</term>.

  The sequence of results that follows shows that homomorphisms preserve several of our ring-theoretic 
  notions. This means <xref ref="def_ringHomomorphism"/> is the <em>right</em>. That is, of all the possible functions between rings 
  we isolated a good class to call structure preserving. We begin by showing that homomorphisms preserve the additive identity.

  Since homomorphisms are compatible with multiplication, and powers of elements are defined with multiplication, they must preserve powers as the next theorem shows.

      Suppose <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism and <m>a\in R</m>. We now proceed by induction. The base case is <m>\varphi(a) = \varphi(a)</m> which 
      certainly true.

    <p>
      For the inductive step, suppose that <m>\varphi(a)^n =\varphi(a^n)</m>. We show <m>\varphi(a)^{n+1} = \varphi(a^{n+1})</m>:

    Kernels are a fundamental structure when studying rings. As a first glimpse of their importance, we show that they give a useful way of 
    determining whether their defining homomorphisms are monomorphisms.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_zeroKernelIsInto">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\varphi \colon R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
        Then <m>\varphi</m> is a monomorphism if and only if <m>\ker\varphi = \{0\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
      Supppose <m>\varphi</m> is a monomomorphism. Since <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism we know <m>\varphi(0) = 0</m>. 
      Suppose now that <m>x\in\ker\varphi</m> so that <m>\varphi(x)=0</m>. Since <m>\varphi</m> is injective and <m>\varphi(x)=\varphi(0)</m>, 
      we conclude that <m>x=0</m>. In particular, <m>\ker\varphi=\{0\}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the converse, suppose that <m>\ker\varphi=\{0\}</m>. Suppose <m>x,y\in R</m> are such that <m>\varphi(x) = \varphi(y)</m>. Then we have:

        and so <m>y-x\in\ker\varphi</m>. Since the only element here is <m>0</m>, we conclude that <m>y-x=0</m> or that <m>y=x</m>. Thus <m>\varphi</m> 
        is a monomorphism.

      A nice application of this theorem is the following result that shows that homomorphisms from a field are always monomorphisms. They will never fail to

      <p>
        Suppose <m>\varphi\colon F\to S</m> is a ring homomorphism where <m>F</m> is a field. We show <m>\varphi</m> is a monomorphism by applying

        there <m>x</m> is a unit. By <xref ref="thm_homomorphismsPreserveUnits"/>, <m>\varphi(x)</m> is also a unit and in particular is not <m>0</m>. Thus

          Gemini, Google's LLM, has claimed that for any ring <m>R</m>, the trace map <m>\mathrm{tr}\colon M_n(R)\to R</m> defined by <m>\mathrm{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}</m> where <m>A=(a_{ij})</m>, is a ring homomorphism. 
          This is true for exactly one <m>n_0\in\N</m>. Find it, prove it is a homomorphism for that <m>n_0</m>, then show it is not a homomorphism for any <m>n\neq n_0</m>.

          Consider the function <m>\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}\colon \Z[x]\to\R</m> defined by <m>\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}(p(x)) = p(\sqrt{2})</m>. Prove that this mapping is a homomorphism. Then show it is neither injective nor bijective. What is it's image?

          Let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a ring homomorphism. Prove that <m>\varphi(0_R) = 0_S</m>. That is, ring homomorphisms also preserve the additive identity.
