      <li>How can we use ideals to build new rings out of old?</li>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    		If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like <m>\Z/m, \Z, \Q, \R, \C</m>, polynomial rings, and matrix rings, 
        there would still be enough to justify defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. 
    		However, these are not the only rings that exist. In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals.
    		To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals.
    		We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.

		The major concept of this section is the notion of congruence modulo <m>I</m>.

    <p>
      Observe that if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
      then there is some <m>x\in I</m> such that <m>b-a = x</m>,
      and so <m>b = a+x</m>.

    <p>
      The notation <m>a+I = b+I</m> is more than just notation. It is an equality of sets. 
      Given any ideal <m>I\subseteq R</m> and any <m>a\in R</m>, define 
      <me>a+I = \{a+i\mid i\in I\}</me>
      to be the set of all translates of <m>I</m> under <m>a</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_congruenceIsEquality">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>I\subseteq R</m> be an ideal and <m>a,b\in R</m>. Then <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m> if and 
          only if we have equality of sets <m>a+I = b+I</m>.  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m>. Then <m>b-a\in I</m> so that <m> b = a+x</m> for some <m>x\in I</m>.
          Take any <m>i\in I</m>, then <m>b+i = a+(x+i)\in a+I</m> as <m>x+i\in I</m>. Thus <m>b+I\subseteq a+I</m>. Using instead <m>a = b+(-x)</m> 
          we have, similarly, that <m>a+I\subseteq b+I</m>. Thus <m>a+I = b+I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a+I = b+I</m>. Since <m>0\in I</m>, we know that <m>b = b+0\in b+I</m>. Since <m>a+I = b+I</m>, we have that <m>b\in a+I</m>. 
          Thus <m>b = a + x</m> for some <m>x\in I</m>. Equivalently <m>b-a=x\in I</m>. Thus <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m>.

        <p>
          Given an ideal <m>I\subseteq R</m> in a commutative ring <m>R</m>. A <term>coset</term> of <m>I</m> is a set of the form 
          <me>a+I = \{a+i\mid i\in I\}.</me>
          The collection of all cosets is denoted <m>R/I</m> or <m>\bar{R}</m> if <m>I</m> is understood:

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We take a minute to observe that in <m>\Z</m> the notion of congruence: <m>a\equiv b</m> modulo <m>m</m> is equivalent to the definition here. 
          Indeed, any <m>m\in\Z</m> defines a principal ideal <m>(m)</m>. If <m>a\equiv_m b</m>, then <m>b-a = mk</m> for some <m>k\in \Z</m>. Hence, <m>b-a\in (m)</m>.
          And conversely, if <m>a+(m) = b+(m)</m>, then <m>b-a\in (m)</m>. Thus there exists <m>k\in\Z</m> with <m>b-a = mk</m> and so <m>a\equiv_mb</m>.

        <p>
          In particular, this is a successful generalization of the notion of congruence modulo <m>m</m>.

    	As was the case in <m>\Z_m</m>, congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,
        so <m>a + I = a+I</m> and the relation is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
        then <m>-1(b-a) = a-b \in I</m>,
        so the relation is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>b-a \in I</m> and <m>c-b\in I</m>,
        then <m>(b-a) + (c-b) = c-a \in I</m>,
        so the relation is transitive.

        <p>
          It's standard practice to identify the principal ideal <m>(r)</m> with <m>r</m> when no confusion can arise.  
          In <m>\Z</m>, the set of equivalence classes modulo <m>(m)</m> is denoted by <m>\Z/m</m> instead of <m>\Z/(m)</m>. 
        </p>
      </aside>

    <p>
      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>. In particular, What is more, this is not merely a set of equivalence classes.
      As the next two theorems demonstrate, this set possesses two algebraic operations that extend naturally from those of <m>R</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_additionModI">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>. If <m>a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2\in R</m> such that
          <m>a_1+I = a_2+I</m> and <m>b_1+I = b_2+I</m>, then <m>(a_1+b_1) + I = (a_2+b_2) + I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>a_1+I = a_2+I</m> and <m>b_1+I = b_2+I</m>.
        Then <m>a_2-a_1 = x \in I</m> and <m>b_2-b_1 = y \in I</m>.
        Adding, we have

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          If <m>a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2\in R</m> such that

        As before, we observe that

        Write <m>a_2 = a_1+x</m> and <m>b_2 = b_1+y</m>.

      The preceeding proof used two properties of <m>I</m>: closure under addition and closure under multiplication by <m>R</m>.

    <p>
      The previous two theorems together show that addition and multiplication on the set <m>R/I</m> is well-defined.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring, <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>, and <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          The set of cosets of <m>I</m>, denoted <m>\bar{R} = R/I</m>,
          is a commutative ring (called the <term>quotient ring</term> of <m>R</m> by <m>I</m>) with additive identity <m>0_R+I</m> and 
          multiplicative identity <m>1_R + I</m> under the following operations:
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>(a+I) + (b+I) &amp; := (a+b) + I</mrow>
          <mrow>(a+I) \cdot (b+I) &amp; := (ab) + I.</mrow>
        </md>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
      	  These operations were shown to be well-defined in <xref ref="thm_additionModI" /> and <xref ref="thm_multiplicationModI" />. We need to show 
          that, with these operations, all eight ring axioms hold and that multiplication is commutative. Take <m>a+I,b+I,c+I\in R/I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin with the additive axioms. For associativity:
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+I) + ((b+I)+(c+I)) \amp= (a+I) + ((b+c)+I) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a+(b+c))+I</mrow>
            <mrow>((a+I) + (b+I))+(c+I) \amp= ((a+b)+I) + (c+I) </mrow> 
            <mrow> \amp= ((a+b)+c)+I.</mrow>
          </md>
          Since <m>R</m> has associative addition we have <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m> and so 
          <me>
            a+(b+c) +I = (a+b)+c + I
          </me>
          the cosets are equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For commutativity:
          <me>(a+I) + (b+I) = (a+b) + I = (b+a)+I = (b+I)+(a+I).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For identity:
          <me>(0_R+I)+(a+I) = (0_R+a) + I = a+I</me>
          as <m>0_R</m> is the additive identity in <m>R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For inverses:
          <me>(a+I) + ((-a)+I) = (a+(-a)) + I = 0_R + I</me>
          and so the additive inverse of <m>a+I</m> is <m>-a+I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now turn to the multiplicative axioms plus commutativity. For associativity:
          <md>
            <mrow> (a+I)((b+I)(c+I))\amp= (a+I)(bc+I) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= a(bc) + I </mrow>
            <mrow> ((a+I)(b+I))(c+I) \amp= (ab+I)(c+I) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ab)c+I </mrow>
          </md>
          But multiplication in <m>R</m> is associative so that <m>a(bc) = (ab)c</m>. Hence,
          <me>a(bc)+I = (ab)c+I.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For commutativity:
          <me>(a+I)(b+I) = (ab)+I = (ba)+I = (b+I)(a+I).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For identity:
          <me>(1_R+I)(a+I) = (1_R\cdot a)+I = a+I</me>
          as <m>1_R</m> is the multiplicative identity in <m>R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>R/I</m> has commutative multiplication we only need to check the left-distributive axiom. 
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+I)( (b+I) + (c+I)) \amp= (a+I)( (b+c) + I) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (a(b+c)) + I </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ab+ac) + I</mrow>
            <mrow>(a+I)(b+I)+ (a+I)(c+I) \amp= (ab)+I + (ac)+I </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= (ab+ac) + I </mrow>
          </md>
          where we have used that multiplication in <m>R</m> has the left-distributive property in line 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude that <m>R/I</m> is a commutative ring.

    we will explore the question of when <m>R/I</m> possesses some of the properties we've previously explored, 
    e.g., when is <m>R/I</m> a domain? A field? First, we conclude with two explorations. The first gives us a 
    sense of what these rings can look like. The second connects quotient rings 
    to <em>solution sets</em> of polynomial equations.

    	<title>Noether Isomorphism Theorem</title>
    	
    	<p>
    		As quotient rings provide fertile soil for building new examples of rings, it should not surprise us to find that homomorphisms interact with quotient rings in interesting and useful ways.
    		Chief among them are the <em>isomorphism theorems</em>. In this subsection, we focus primarily on the Noether Isomorphism Theorem (also 
        called the First Isomorphism Theorem).
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		We have seen that any homomorphism <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> gives rise to an ideal of <m>R</m>, namely <m>\ker\varphi</m>. 
    		Our next theorem demonstrates that, given a commutative ring <m>R</m>, every ideal is the kernel of 
        some homomorphism defined on <m>R</m>. In particular, our definition of ideal accurately captured what it meant to be a kernel.
    	</p>

    	<theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Define <m>\varphi\colon R\to R/I</m> by <m>\varphi(r) = r+I</m>.
          Then <m>\varphi</m> is an epimorphism with <m>\ker\varphi = I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first verify that <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism. Note that <m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_R+I</m> which 
          is the multiplicative identity in <m>R/I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For compatibility with addition:
          <me>\varphi(a+b) = a+b+I = (a+I) + (b+I) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For compatibility with multiplication:
          <me>\varphi(ab) = ab+I = (a+I)(b+I) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b).</me>
          Thus <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          That <m>\varphi</m> is surjective is clear: for any <m>a+I\in R/I</m> we have <m>\varphi(a)  = a+I</m>. Lastly, suppose 
          <m>\varphi(x) = 0_R + I</m>. Then <m>x+I = 0_R+I</m> so that <m>x\in I</m>. Thus <m>\ker\varphi\subseteq I</m>. Also for any 
          <m>x\in I</m> we have <m>\varphi(x) = x+ I = I</m> so that <m>x\in \ker\varphi</m> which shows <m>\ker\varphi = I</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      This is just a generalization of <xref ref="thm_reductionModuloMIsHomomorphism"/>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We work toward a proof of the Noether Isomorphism Theorem for Rings. The proof will proceed by a sequence of lemmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings,
      and let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
      Recall that 
      <me>
        \mathrm{im} \varphi = \{s\in S\mid \varphi(r) = s\text{ for some } r\in R\}
      </me> 
      is a subring of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>f\colon R/\ker \varphi \to \mathrm{im} \varphi</m> by <m>f(r+\ker \varphi) = \varphi(r)</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation from above, <m>f</m> is a well-defined function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r_1 + \ker\varphi = r_2 + \ker\varphi</m>.
        Then <m>r_2-r_1 \in \ker\varphi</m>,
        so <m>\varphi(r_2-r_1) = 0_S</m>, and thus <m>\varphi(r_1) = \varphi(r_2)</m>.
        Therefore, <m>f(r_1+\ker\varphi) = f(r_2+\ker\varphi)</m>,
        and <m>f</m> is well-defined.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We have <m>f(1_R+\ker\varphi) = \varphi(1_R) = 1_S</m> as <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly. We compute:
        <md>
          <mrow> f((x+\ker\varphi) + (y+\ker\varphi)) \amp= f((x+y)+\ker\varphi) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \varphi(x+y) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \varphi(x)+\varphi(y) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= f(x+\ker\varphi) + f(y+\ker\varphi)</mrow>
        </md>
        where we have used that <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism in line 2.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f(r_1 + \ker\varphi) = f(r_2 + \ker\varphi)</m>.
        That is, <m>\varphi(r_1) = \varphi(r_2)</m>.
        Then <m>\varphi(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\varphi</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\varphi = r_2 + \ker \varphi</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is onto.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\varphi</m> is onto <m>\mathrm{im} \varphi</m> by definition,
        given any <m>s\in \mathrm{im} \varphi</m> there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>\varphi(r) = s</m>.
        Then <m>f(r+\ker\varphi) = \varphi(r)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We thus obtain the following, due to Emmy Noether:

          Let <m>\varphi \colon R\to S</m> be a homomorphism of commutative rings.
          Then <m>R/\ker \varphi \cong \mathrm{im} \varphi</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular,
          if <m>\varphi \colon R\to S</m> is an epimorphism (it is onto), <m>R/\ker \varphi \cong S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    	The Noether Isomorphism Theorem gives a useful way of establishing an isomorphism between a 
      quotient ring <m>R/I</m> and another ring <m>S</m>: find an onto homomorphism <m>R\to S</m> with kernel <m>I</m>.

      <title>Applying the Noether Isomorphism Theorem</title>
      
      <p>
        In the next three examples, we make heavy use of the evaluation homomorphism. We prove three separate isomorphisms using it.
      </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is an isomorphism of rings <m>\Z[x]/(x)\cong \Z</m>. Indeed, let us consider the evaluation homomorphism
          <me>\mathrm{ev}_0\colon\Z[x]\to \Z</me>
          defined by <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = f(0)</m>. We have seen it is a homomorphism in Exercise??? 
        </p>
        <p>
          Evaluation is an epimorphism: Pick any <m>a\in\Z</m> and consider the polynomial <m>f(x) = a</m>. Then <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = f(0) = a</m>.
          Since evaluation is a surjective homomorphism it is an epimorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim the kernel of evaluation at zero is <m>(x)</m>. Suppose <m>f(x) = a_0+a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n\in \ker\mathrm{ev}_0</m>. Then 
          <me>0 = \mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = a_0</me>
          and so <m>a_0 = 0</m>. We conclude 
          <me>f(x) = a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n = x(a_1+\cdots +a_nx^{n-1})</me>.
          and so <m>f(x)\in (x)</m>. Thus <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = (x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Noether Isomorphism Theorem we have <m>\Z[x]/(x)\cong \Z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      The previous example illustrates the power of the evaluation mapping. Here's another (similar) example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is an isomorphism of rings <m>\Q[x]/(x-5)\cong \Q</m>. Indeed, let us consider the evaluation at <m>5</m> mapping:
          <me>\mathrm{ev}_5\colon\Q[x]\to\Q</me>
          defined by <m>\mathrm{ev}_5(f(x)) = f(5)</m>. It is a homomorphism and, in a manner similar to the previous example but using polynomial
          division, we can see that <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_5 = (x-5)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The evaluation at <m>5</m> mapping is an epimorphism as for any <m>r\in\Q</m> we have <m>\mathrm{ev}_5(r) = r</m>. By the Noether Isomorphism 
          Theorem <m>\Q[x]/(x-5)\cong \Q</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course nothing is special about <m>5</m> here. You will prove a general theorem in Exercise????
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex_algebraicDefinitionC">
      <title>Algebraic Definition of Complex Numbers</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          At this point, we've seen two different incarnations of the complex numbers. Refernce definition and Example ?????
          We will show yet another way of constructing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mathrm{ev}_i\colon\R[x]\to\C</m> be the evaluation at <m>i</m> mapping. Evaluation is a homomorphism. Let's also note that 
          <m>\mathrm{ev}_i(a+bx) = a+bi</m>. Thus <m>\mathrm{ev}_i</m> is an epimorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\mathrm{ev}_i(x^2+1) = i^2+1 = -1+1 = 0</m> we know that <m>x^2+1\in\ker\mathrm{ev}_i</m>. When we get to factorizations in the next chapter 
          we will use the division algorithm to revisit this example and prove that <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_i = (x^2+1)</m>. At the moment we do not yet have the Euclidean 
          Algorithm at our disposal. Nevertheless, it is true so by the Noether Isomorphism Theorem <m>\R[x]/(x^2+1)\cong\C</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One could redefine the complex numbers as <m>\R[x]/(x^2+1)</m> and this is a purely algebraic definition of <m>\C</m> (up to using <m>\R</m>).
