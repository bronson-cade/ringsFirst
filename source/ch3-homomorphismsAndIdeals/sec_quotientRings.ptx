      <li>How can we use ideals to build new rings out of old?</li>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    		If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like <m>\Z/m, \Z, \Q, \R, \C</m>, polynomial rings, and matrix rings, 
        there would still be enough to justify defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. 
    		However, these are not the only rings that exist. In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals.
    		To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals.
    		We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.

	<title>Congruence modulo <m>I</m></title>
	<p>
		The major concept of this section is the notion of congruence modulo <m>I</m>.
		One can reasonably think of this idea as a generalization of congruence modulo <m>m</m> in <m>\Z</m>.
	</p>


    <definition>
    <idx>congruence mod <m>I</m></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring, <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>, and <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          We say <m>a</m> is
          <term>congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m></term> if <m>b-a\in I</m>.
          If this is the case, we write <m>a + I = b + I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <title>Congruence modulo <m>(m)</m></title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We first show that in the case <m>R=\Z</m>, congruence modulo <m>(m)</m> is the same 
          as congruence modulo <m>m</m>. Indeed, supppose <m>a,b\in\Z</m> are congruent modulo <m>(m)</m>. 
          Then <m>b-a\in (m)</m> and so <m>b-a=mk</m> for some <m>k\in\Z</m>. Hence, <m>a\equiv_m b</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The preceeding argument is an if and only if argument so can be read in reverse too. Hence, 
          congruence modulo <m>(m)</m> and congruence modulo <m>m</m> agree.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>Congruence in <m>\Z[x]</m></title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's now work in <m>R=\Z[x]</m> and first consider the ideal <m>(6)</m>. Are <m>9x</m> and <m>3x</m> congruent modulo <m>(6)</m>?
          The difference is <m>3x-9x=6(-x)\in (6)</m> and so they are congruent modulo <m>6</m>. What other elements are congruent modulo <m>6</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          What other elements are congruent modulo <m>(6)</m>? Let's first better understand <m>(6)</m>. This is the set of all integral polynomial 
          multiples of <m>6</m>:
          <me>
            (6) = \{6p(x)\mid p(x)\in\Z[x]\}.
          </me>
          In particular, all coefficients of elements of <m>(6)</m> are multiples of <m>6</m>. From this we learn that <m>p(x),q(x)\in \Z[x]</m> are 
          congruent modulo <m>(6)</m> if and only if the coefficients of their difference are divisible by <m>6</m>. So, for example, <m>9x,3</m> are not 
          congruent modulo <m>6</m>, while <m>9x^2+12x-32</m> and <m>21x^2-38</m> are congruent modulo <m>6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look at another ideal here, say <m>(x)\subseteq \Z[x]</m>. As a first example, <m>9x</m> and <m>3x</m> are congruent modulo <m>(x)</m> as 
          <m>3x-9x=(-6)x\in(x)</m>. However, <m>9x^2+12x-32,21x^2-38</m> are not congruent modulo <m>(x)</m> as their difference is <m>12x^2-12x-6</m> 
          which is not a multiple of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it mean here to be congruent modulo <m>(x)</m>? Again, let's better understand the ideal <m>(x)</m>:
          <me>
            (x) = \{xp(x)\mid p(x)\in\Z[x]\}
          </me>
          and so elements of <m>(x)</m> are precisely the polynomials without a constant term. In particular, two elements <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> are 
          congruent modulo <m>(x)</m> if and only if they have identical constant term as their difference needs to not have a constant term. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the polynomial <m>9x^2+12-32</m> and <m>21x^2-32</m> are congruent modulo <m>(x)</m> while the polynomials <m>9x,3</m> are not.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>Congruence in <m>\C[x,y]</m></title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's now look at a more complicated example: the ideal <m>(x,y)\subseteq \C[x,y]</m>. 
          This ideal is not principal and as a reminder it is equal to:
          <me>
            (x,y) = \{xp(x,y)+yq(x,y)\mid p(x,y),q(x,y)\in\C[x,y]\}.
          </me>
          That is, it is all polynomial combinations of <m>x,y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is congruence modulo <m>(x,y)</m>? We consider a couple of examples first. The polynomials <m>x+y-2</m> and <m>xy+2x-2</m> are congruent modulo <m>(x,y)</m> 
          as
          <me>
            xy+2x-2-(x+y-2) = xy+x-y = x(y+1)+y(-1).
          </me>
          and so the difference is a polynomial combination of <m>x,y</m>. As another example, we see that <m>xy-x-y</m> and <m>x^2+xy+y^2</m> are also 
          congruent modulo <m>(x,y)</m>:
          <me>
            x^2+xy+y^2 - (xy-x-y) = x^2+y^2+x+y = x(x+1) + y(y+1)
          </me>
          and the difference is again a polynomial combination of <m>x,y</m>. Let's look at <m>xy+y+1</m> and <m>2xy+2x-3y+2</m>:
          <me>
            2xy+2x-3y+2-(xy+y+1) = xy+2x-4y+1.
          </me>
          This polynomial cannot be written as a polynomial combination of <m>x,y</m> because such combinations cannot have a constant term!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our sequence of example elements seems to indicate that polynomials are congruent modulo <m>(x,y)</m> if and only if they have the same constant term. 
          And indeed this is the case. The details of which are left as an exercise which is primarily an exercise in multivariate polynomial notation.

      Observe that if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
      then there is some <m>x\in I</m> such that <m>b-a = x</m>,
      and so <m>b = a+x</m>.

    <p>
      The notation <m>a+I = b+I</m> is more than just notation. It is an equality of sets. 
      Given any ideal <m>I\subseteq R</m> and any <m>a\in R</m>, define 
      <me>a+I = \{a+i\mid i\in I\}</me>
      to be the set of all translates of <m>I</m> under <m>a</m>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_congruenceIsEquality">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>I\subseteq R</m> be an ideal and <m>a,b\in R</m>. Then <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m> if and 
          only if we have equality of sets <m>a+I = b+I</m>.  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m>. Then <m>b-a\in I</m> so that <m> b = a+x</m> for some <m>x\in I</m>.
          Take any <m>i\in I</m>, then <m>b+i = a+(x+i)\in a+I</m> as <m>x+i\in I</m>. Thus <m>b+I\subseteq a+I</m>. Using instead <m>a = b+(-x)</m> 
          we have, similarly, that <m>a+I\subseteq b+I</m>. Thus <m>a+I = b+I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a+I = b+I</m>. Since <m>0\in I</m>, we know that <m>b = b+0\in b+I</m>. Since <m>a+I = b+I</m>, we have that <m>b\in a+I</m>. 
          Thus <m>b = a + x</m> for some <m>x\in I</m>. Equivalently <m>b-a=x\in I</m>. Thus <m>a</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m>.

          We take a minute to observe that in <m>\Z</m> the notion of congruence: <m>a\equiv b</m> modulo <m>m</m> is equivalent to the definition here. 
          Indeed, any <m>m\in\Z</m> defines a principal ideal <m>(m)</m>. If <m>a\equiv_m b</m>, then <m>b-a = mk</m> for some <m>k\in \Z</m>. Hence, <m>b-a\in (m)</m>.
          And conversely, if <m>a+(m) = b+(m)</m>, then <m>b-a\in (m)</m>. Thus there exists <m>k\in\Z</m> with <m>b-a = mk</m> and so <m>a\equiv_mb</m>.

          In particular, this is a successful generalization of the notion of congruence modulo <m>m</m>.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,
        so <m>a + I = a+I</m> and the relation is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
        then <m>-1(b-a) = a-b \in I</m>,
        so the relation is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>b-a \in I</m> and <m>c-b\in I</m>,
        then <m>(b-a) + (c-b) = c-a \in I</m>,
        so the relation is transitive.

          It's standard practice to identify the principal ideal <m>(r)</m> with <m>r</m> when no confusion can arise.  
          In <m>\Z</m>, the set of equivalence classes modulo <m>(m)</m> is denoted by <m>\Z/m</m> instead of <m>\Z/(m)</m>.

      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>. In particular, What is more, this is not merely a set of equivalence classes.

          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring, <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>, and <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          The set of cosets of <m>I</m>, denoted <m>\bar{R} = R/I</m>,
          is a commutative ring (called the <term>quotient ring</term> of <m>R</m> by <m>I</m>) with additive identity <m>0_R+I</m> and

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
      	  These operations were shown to be well-defined in <xref ref="thm_additionModI" /> and <xref ref="thm_multiplicationModI" />. We need to show 
          that, with these operations, all eight ring axioms hold and that multiplication is commutative. Take <m>a+I,b+I,c+I\in R/I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin with the additive axioms. For associativity:
          <md>
            <mrow>(a+I) + ((b+I)+(c+I)) \amp= (a+I) + ((b+c)+I) </mrow>

            <mrow> \amp= ((a+b)+c)+I.</mrow>
          </md>
          Since <m>R</m> has associative addition we have <m>a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c</m> and so 
          <me>
            a+(b+c) +I = (a+b)+c + I
          </me>
          the cosets are equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For commutativity:
          <me>(a+I) + (b+I) = (a+b) + I = (b+a)+I = (b+I)+(a+I).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For identity:
          <me>(0_R+I)+(a+I) = (0_R+a) + I = a+I</me>
          as <m>0_R</m> is the additive identity in <m>R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For inverses:
          <me>(a+I) + ((-a)+I) = (a+(-a)) + I = 0_R + I</me>
          and so the additive inverse of <m>a+I</m> is <m>-a+I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now turn to the multiplicative axioms plus commutativity. For associativity:

    	<title>Noether Isomorphism Theorem</title>
    	
    	<p>
    		As quotient rings provide fertile soil for building new examples of rings, it should not surprise us to find that homomorphisms interact with quotient rings in interesting and useful ways.
    		Chief among them are the <em>isomorphism theorems</em>. In this subsection, we focus primarily on the Noether Isomorphism Theorem (also 
        called the First Isomorphism Theorem).
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		We have seen that any homomorphism <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> gives rise to an ideal of <m>R</m>, namely <m>\ker\varphi</m>. 
    		Our next theorem demonstrates that, given a commutative ring <m>R</m>, every ideal is the kernel of 
        some homomorphism defined on <m>R</m>. In particular, our definition of ideal accurately captured what it meant to be a kernel.
    	</p>

    	<theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Define <m>\varphi\colon R\to R/I</m> by <m>\varphi(r) = r+I</m>.
          Then <m>\varphi</m> is an epimorphism with <m>\ker\varphi = I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first verify that <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism. Note that <m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_R+I</m> which 
          is the multiplicative identity in <m>R/I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For compatibility with addition:
          <me>\varphi(a+b) = a+b+I = (a+I) + (b+I) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b).</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For compatibility with multiplication:
          <me>\varphi(ab) = ab+I = (a+I)(b+I) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b).</me>
          Thus <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          That <m>\varphi</m> is surjective is clear: for any <m>a+I\in R/I</m> we have <m>\varphi(a)  = a+I</m>. Lastly, suppose 
          <m>\varphi(x) = 0_R + I</m>. Then <m>x+I = 0_R+I</m> so that <m>x\in I</m>. Thus <m>\ker\varphi\subseteq I</m>. Also for any 
          <m>x\in I</m> we have <m>\varphi(x) = x+ I = I</m> so that <m>x\in \ker\varphi</m> which shows <m>\ker\varphi = I</m>.

    <p>
      We work toward a proof of the Noether Isomorphism Theorem for Rings. The proof will proceed by a sequence of lemmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings,
      and let <m>\varphi\colon R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
      Recall that 
      <me>
        \mathrm{im} \varphi = \{s\in S\mid \varphi(r) = s\text{ for some } r\in R\}
      </me> 
      is a subring of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>f\colon R/\ker \varphi \to \mathrm{im} \varphi</m> by <m>f(r+\ker \varphi) = \varphi(r)</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation from above, <m>f</m> is a well-defined function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r_1 + \ker\varphi = r_2 + \ker\varphi</m>.
        Then <m>r_2-r_1 \in \ker\varphi</m>,
        so <m>\varphi(r_2-r_1) = 0_S</m>, and thus <m>\varphi(r_1) = \varphi(r_2)</m>.
        Therefore, <m>f(r_1+\ker\varphi) = f(r_2+\ker\varphi)</m>,
        and <m>f</m> is well-defined.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We have <m>f(1_R+\ker\varphi) = \varphi(1_R) = 1_S</m> as <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly. We compute:
        <md>
          <mrow> f((x+\ker\varphi) + (y+\ker\varphi)) \amp= f((x+y)+\ker\varphi) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \varphi(x+y) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= \varphi(x)+\varphi(y) </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp= f(x+\ker\varphi) + f(y+\ker\varphi)</mrow>
        </md>
        where we have used that <m>\varphi</m> is a homomorphism in line 2.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f(r_1 + \ker\varphi) = f(r_2 + \ker\varphi)</m>.
        That is, <m>\varphi(r_1) = \varphi(r_2)</m>.
        Then <m>\varphi(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\varphi</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\varphi = r_2 + \ker \varphi</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is onto.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\varphi</m> is onto <m>\mathrm{im} \varphi</m> by definition,
        given any <m>s\in \mathrm{im} \varphi</m> there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>\varphi(r) = s</m>.
        Then <m>f(r+\ker\varphi) = \varphi(r)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We thus obtain the following, due to Emmy Noether:

    	<idx>First Isomorphism Theorem</idx>
      <idx><h>Noether Isomorphism Theorem</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\varphi \colon R\to S</m> be a homomorphism of commutative rings.
          Then <m>R/\ker \varphi \cong \mathrm{im} \varphi</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular,
          if <m>\varphi \colon R\to S</m> is an epimorphism (it is onto), <m>R/\ker \varphi \cong S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    	The Noether Isomorphism Theorem gives a useful way of establishing an isomorphism between a 
      quotient ring <m>R/I</m> and another ring <m>S</m>: find an onto homomorphism <m>R\to S</m> with kernel <m>I</m>.
      It's helpful to think of the Noether isomorphism theorem in terms of a diagram:
    <me>
      \begin{CD}
      R @>\varphi>> S\\
      @VVV @AAA\\
      R/\ker\varphi @>\sim>> \mathrm{im}\varphi 
      \end{CD}
    </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The way we read these diagrams is if you start with an element at any of the nodes and compute the images under each arrow. You should always end up with the same spot. 
      In this context, to compute <m>\varphi(r)</m>, we can first surject onto <m>R/\ker\varphi</m> sending <m>r\to\bar{r}</m>. Then apply the Noether isomorphism 
      <m>f(\bar{r}) = \varphi(r)</m>. Then include that into <m>S</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagram is meant to visualize a factorization of <m>\varphi</m> into varies pieces. In particular, we see that any homomorphism factors into the composite of an epimorphism 
      followed by a monomorphism.

      <title>Applying the Noether Isomorphism Theorem</title>
      
      <p>
        In the next three examples, we make heavy use of the fact that the evaluation homomorphism from 
        <xref ref="exer_evaluationHomomorphism"/> is a homomorphism. We prove three separate isomorphisms using it.
      </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is an isomorphism of rings <m>\Z[x]/(x)\cong \Z</m>. Indeed, let us consider the evaluation homomorphism
          <me>\mathrm{ev}_0\colon\Z[x]\to \Z</me>
          defined by <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = f(0)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Evaluation is an epimorphism: Pick any <m>a\in\Z</m> and consider the polynomial <m>f(x) = a</m>. Then <m>\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = f(0) = a</m>.
          Since evaluation is a surjective homomorphism it is an epimorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim the kernel of evaluation at zero is <m>(x)</m>. Suppose <m>f(x) = a_0+a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n\in \ker\mathrm{ev}_0</m>. Then 
          <me>0 = \mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = a_0</me>
          and so <m>a_0 = 0</m>. We conclude 
          <me>f(x) = a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n = x(a_1+\cdots +a_nx^{n-1})</me>.
          and so <m>f(x)\in (x)</m>. Thus <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_0(f(x)) = (x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the Noether Isomorphism Theorem we have <m>\Z[x]/(x)\cong \Z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      The previous example illustrates the power of the evaluation mapping. Here's another (similar) example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There is an isomorphism of rings <m>\Q[x]/(x-5)\cong \Q</m>. Indeed, let us consider the evaluation at <m>5</m> mapping:
          <me>\mathrm{ev}_5\colon\Q[x]\to\Q</me>
          defined by <m>\mathrm{ev}_5(f(x)) = f(5)</m>. In a manner similar to the previous example but using polynomial
          division, we can see that <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_5 = (x-5)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The evaluation at <m>5</m> mapping is an epimorphism as for any <m>r\in\Q</m> we have <m>\mathrm{ev}_5(r) = r</m>. By the Noether Isomorphism 
          Theorem <m>\Q[x]/(x-5)\cong \Q</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course nothing is special about <m>5</m> here. You will prove a general theorem in Exercise????
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex_algebraicDefinitionC">
      <title>Algebraic Definition of Complex Numbers</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          At this point, we've seen two different incarnations of the complex numbers: <xref ref="def_complexNumbers"/> and <xref ref="exer_complexNumbersAsMatrices"/>
          We will show yet another way of constructing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mathrm{ev}_i\colon\R[x]\to\C</m> be the evaluation at <m>i</m> homomorphism. Let's also note that 
          <m>\mathrm{ev}_i(a+bx) = a+bi</m>. Thus <m>\mathrm{ev}_i</m> is an epimorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\mathrm{ev}_i(x^2+1) = i^2+1 = -1+1 = 0</m> we know that <m>x^2+1\in\ker\mathrm{ev}_i</m>. Suppose that <m>p(x)\in\ker\mathrm{ev}_i</m>. 
          Using the <xref ref="thm_polynomialDivisionAlgorithm" text="title"/>, we can divide <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x^2+1</m> to get 
          <me>
            p(x) = q(x)(x^2+1) + r(x)
          </me>
          where <m>\deg(r(x)) \lt 2</m>. Since <m>p(x)</m> is in the kernel we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>0 \amp= p(i) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=q(i)(i^2+1)+r(i) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=r(i) </mrow>
          </md>
          and so <m>r(i)=0</m>. Since <m>r(x)</m> has degree at most one, we can write <m>r(x) = a+bx</m>. But then 
          <me>
            0=r(i) = a+bi
          </me>
          implies <m>a=0,b=0</m>. Thus <m>r(x) = 0</m> and <m>p(x) = q(x)(x^2+1)</m>. In particular, <m>p(x)\in (x^2+1)</m>. Finally, we can conclude that 
          <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_i = (x^2+1)</m> and by the Noether Isomorphism Theorem

            \R[x]/(x^2+1)\cong \C.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This example shows we could redefine the complex numbers as <m>\R[x]/(x^2+1)</m> and this is a purely algebraic 
          definition of <m>\C</m> (up to using <m>\R</m>).

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's now consider <m>R=\Z[\sqrt{-2}]</m> and the principal ideal <m>I=(1+\sqrt{-2})</m>. Since <m>1+\sqrt{-2}\in(1+\sqrt{-2})</m> 
          we have equality of cosets:
          <me>
            \sqrt{-2} + I = -1+I.
          </me>
          This means that any <m>\sqrt{-2}</m> can be replaced with a <m>-1</m>. And so:
          <me>
            -2+I=(\sqrt{-2}+I)^2 = (-1+I)^2 = 1+I.
          </me>
          In the quotient ring <m>R/I</m> we therefore have <m>3+I = 0+I</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems to indicate that the quotient ring doesn't have a <m>\sqrt{-2}</m> (as it becomes <m>-1</m>) so it's as if we just have <m>\Z</m>. 
          Furthermore, <m>3=0</m> in this ring. One ring that should come to mind is <m>\mathbb{F}_3</m>! Let's try to prove it is isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{F}_3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To apply the Noether Isomorphism Theorem we first need a homomorphism. Whatever the homomorphism we define it should send <m>\sqrt{-2}</m> to <m>-1</m>. 
          Likely it should be similar to the reduction modulo <m>5</m> mapping as well. Coupling these two requirements leads to 
          <m>\varphi\colon\Z[\sqrt{-2}]\to\mathbb{F}_5</m> 
          defined by 
          <me>
            \varphi(a+b\sqrt{-2}) = \overline{a-b}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's check it is a homomorphism: <m>\varphi(1) = \bar{1}</m> and so <m>\varphi</m> preserves unity. For <m>a+b\sqrt{-2},c+d\sqrt{-2}\in\Z[\sqrt{-2}]</m> we have 
          <md>
            <mrow>\varphi((a+b\sqrt{-2})(c+d\sqrt{-2})) \amp= \varphi(ac-2bd+(ad+bc)\sqrt{-2}) </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=\overline{ac-2bd-(ad+bc)} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=\overline{ac-2bd-ad-bc)} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=\overline{ac+bd-ad-bc} </mrow>
            <mrow> \varphi(a+b\sqrt{-2})\varphi(c+d\sqrt{-2})\amp=\overline{a-b}\cdot\overline{c-d} </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \overline{ac+bd-bc-ad} </mrow>
          </md>
          and so it preserves multiplication. That it preserves addition will be left as an exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now turn to the kernel. Evidently <m>\varphi(1+\sqrt{-2}) = \overline{1-1}=\bar{0}</m>. So that <m>I\subseteq \ker\varphi</m>. 
          Before we show the reverse containment observe that for any <m>k\in\Z</m> we have:
          <me>
            k(1-\sqrt{-2})\cdot (1+\sqrt{-2})=3k\in I.
          </me>
        </p>
          
        <p>
          Now for the reverse containment, we notice that if <m>a+b\sqrt{-2}\in\ker\varphi</m>, then 
          <me>
            \bar{0}=\varphi(a+b\sqrt{-2}) = \bar{a}-\bar{b}.
          </me>
          Thus there exists <m>k\in\Z</m> with <m>a = b+3k</m>. Thus 
          <me>
            a+b\sqrt{-2} = b+3k+b\sqrt{-2} = b(1+\sqrt{-2}) + 3k
          </me>
          and both of these terms are in <m>I</m>. We conclude <m>\ker\varphi = I</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, by the Noether Isomorphism Theorem we have an isomorphism:
          <me>
            f\colon \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]/(1+\sqrt{-2})\to \mathbb{F}_3
          </me>
          defined by <m>f(a+b\sqrt{-2}+I)=\overline{a-b}</m>.

          any element in <m>\Z[x]/(x^2+1)</m> can be written as a linear coset: <m>a+bx+(x^2+1)</m>. Use this to deduce <m>\ker\subseteq (x^2+1)</m>. Finally 
          use the Noether Isomorphism Theorem to prove the desired isomorphism.

        <p>
          Prove the weak Correspondence Theorem: For any ideals <m>I\subseteq R</m> and <m>\bar{J}\subseteq \bar{R}=R/I</m>, there exists a unique ideal 
          <m>I\subseteq J\subseteq R</m> such that the image of <m>J</m> under the quotient <m>\pi\colon R\to \bar{R}</m> is <m>\bar{J}</m>. Hint: 
          Set
          <me>
            J = \pi^{-1}(J) = \{r\in R\mid \pi(r)\in J\}.
          </me>
          Show that <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>, that it contains <m>I</m>, that <m>\pi(J) = \bar{J}</m>. Then prove that <m>J</m> is unique.
