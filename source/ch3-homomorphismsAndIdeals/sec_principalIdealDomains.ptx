      <li>What are principal ideal domains?</li>
      <li>What are prime and maximal ideals and how can we use them?</li>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The examples at the end of the last section were interesting. In particular, when we looked at the 
      quotient of <m>\R[x]</m> by <m>(x^2+1)</m>. In this section, we aim to give more substance to the 
      Noether Isomorphism theorem in two ways: We isolate a class of domains where ideals are always principal and 
      we introduce two new types of ideals. We then use these ideas to study quotients of polynomials rings.

    <title>Principal Ideal Domains</title>
    
  <p>
    TestIn <m>\Z</m>, and as we will see <m>F[x]</m> where <m>F</m> is a field, ideals are particularly simple in that they 
    are always principal. We first give domains satisfying that property a name.

  <definition>
    <idx><h>Principal Ideal Domain</h></idx>
    <idx><h>PID</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An integral domain <m>R</m> in which every ideal is principal is known as a
        <term>principal ideal domain (PID)</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_ZisPID">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The ring <m>\Z</m> is a principal ideal domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The zero ideal is principally generated by <m>0</m> so we let <m>I\subseteq\Z</m> be a non-zero ideal and show it 
        is principally generated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider <m>S=I\cap \mathbb{N}</m>. Since <m>I\neq \{0\}</m>, there is <m>0\neq a\in I</m>. If <m>a\ge 0</m>, then <m>a\in S</m>. 
        Otherwise <m>-1\cdot a = -a\ge 0</m> so that <m>-a\in S</m> (ideals are closed under multiplication). Thus <m>S</m> is a non-empty subset 
        of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and so it has a least element <m>d</m>. We claim <m>I = (d)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take any other element <m>b\in I</m>, which we assume is positive. Then the division algorithm tells us there exists <m>q,r\in\N</m> with 
        <m>0\leq r \lt d</m> such that <m>b = dq+r</m>. But this would tell us <m>r = b-dq\in I</m> and <m>r \lt d</m>. Since <m>d</m> is the least 
        positive element of <m>I</m>, this can only happen if <m>r=0</m> and so <m>b=dq</m> and <m>b\in (d)</m>. Therefore <m>I=(d)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>\Z</m> is a PID.

  <p>
    Notice that for any non-zero ideal of <m>\Z</m>, the greatest common divisor of all the elements is a principal generator (the negative of it is too). 
    We can use this to find the principal generator for ideals generated by more than one element:

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a principal ideal domain and <m>x,y\in R</m> be not both zero.
        Let <m>I = \{xm+yn\mid m,n\in R\}</m>.
        Then:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>I</m> is an ideal, so there is some <m>d\in R</m> for which <m>I = (d)</m>;

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d</m> is a <xref ref="def_gcdDomain" text="custom">greatest common divisor</xref> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that there exist
        <m>s,t\in R</m> such that <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = x0 + y0 \in I</m>.
      Additionally, if <m>x m_1 + y n_1, x m_2 + y n_2\in I</m>,
      then <m>(x m_1 + y n_1) + (x m_2 + y n_2) = x (m_1 + m_2) + y (n_1 + n_2) \in I</m>,
      and <m>r(x m_1 + y n_1) = x (rm_1) + y(rn_1) \in I</m>.
      Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there exists <m>d\in R</m> such that <m>I = (d)</m>.
      We claim that <m>d</m> is a GCD of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that <m>d|x</m>, as <m>x\cdot 1 + y\cdot 0\in I = (d)</m>.
      Similarly, <m>d|y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>e\in R</m> be a common divisor of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      We wish to show that <m>e|d</m>.
      Write <m>x = e k_1</m> and <m>y = e k_2</m>.
      Since <m>d\in (d)</m>,
      there exist <m>s,t\in R</m> such that
      <m>d = x s + yt = (e k_1) s + (e k_2)t = e(k_1 s + k_2 t)</m>,
      and thus <m>e|d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, there exist
      <m>s,t\in R</m> such that a GCD <m>d</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    We have so far abstracted and axiomatized several important algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m> that we discussed in <xref ref="sec_integers">&#xa7;</xref>.
    In particular, we have our usual operations of addition and multiplication,
    and their interactions, we have notions of divisibility/factorization, irreducibility, and primality;
    we also have cancellation and greatest common divisors.
  </p>

<!--
  <p>
    Our last major abstraction from <m>\Z</m> is the division algorithm.
    The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations.
    That is, if <m>R</m> is an arbitrary domain with <m>r,s\in R</m>,
    is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <m>r</m> or <m>s</m> is
    <q>bigger</q>
    ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However,
    if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <m>R</m> to <m>\N_0</m>,
    we can sensibly define a division algorithm.

              If <m>a,b\in R</m>, <m>b\ne 0</m>,
              then there exist <m>q,r\in R</m> such that <m>a = bq+r</m>,
              where either <m>r = 0</m> or <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(b)</m>.

    Thus, a Euclidean domain is an integral domain with a division algorithm that behaves in a familiar way. In the remainder of this section, we will investigate the properties of Euclidean domains.
    First, we consider some examples.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec_polynomialRingsOverAField">
    <title>Polynomial Rings over a Field</title>
    
    <p>
      Our next goal is to prove that polynomial rings over a field are always a PID. In the course of the proof we will notice that 
      such rings share a lot in common (factorization-wise) with integers. The key to factorization here is the degree function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start by proving any ideal (or any non-zero subset) of a polynomial ring has an element of least degree.
    </p>
  <lemma xml:id="lem_minimalDegreePoly">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>S\subseteq F[x]</m> a set containing a nonzero polynomial.
        Prove that <m>S</m> contains a polynomial <m>f</m> such that
        <m>\deg(f) \le \deg(g)</m> for all nonzero <m>g\in S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>T = \{\deg g\mid g\in S\}</m>.
      Since <m>S</m> contains a nonzero polynomial, <m>T\ne \emptyset</m>.
      By WOP, <m>T</m> contains a minimal element <m>d \ge 0</m>,
      which must be the degree of some polynomial in <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
</lemma>
<p>
  Notice that in the proof of <xref ref="lem_minimalDegreePoly" /> we did not use that <m>F</m> was a field.
  In particular, we only need that there are non-zero polynomials, i.e. the coefficient ring is a non-zero ring.
</p>
<p>
  Our next result is a helpful lemma that will simplify our proof of the polynomial division algorithm. Although 
  the statement looks somewhat complicated, it is just spelling out polynomial long-division.

      The leading term of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>a_m x^m</m>,

        In the last case, use induction on <m>m = \deg f(x)</m>.
        For uniqueness,
        mimic the uniqueness proof of <xref ref="thm_divalg">Theorem</xref>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      <em>Existence:</em> If <m>f(x) = 0</m>,
      then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = 0</m> will do.
      If <m>f(x)\ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \lt \deg g</m>,
      then <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = f(x)</m> will suffice.
      Thus, we need only consider the case in which
      <m>f(x) \ne 0</m> and <m>\deg f \ge \deg g</m>.
      We use induction on <m>\deg f = m</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <m>m = 0</m>, <m>\deg g \le 0 = \deg f</m>,
      and as <m>g(x) \ne 0</m>, both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are nonzero constants.
      Then <m>r = 0</m> and <m>q = fg^{-1}</m> will work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> exist whenever <m>\deg f \lt m</m>.
      Assume <m>\deg f = m</m> and write
      <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m</m> and <m>g(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n</m>.
      Use <xref ref="lem_polydivalglem">Lemma</xref>
      and set <m>h(x) = f(x) - a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} g(x)</m>,
      which must have degree less than <m>f</m>.
      Thus, by induction, there exist
      <m>q_1, r_1\in F[x]</m> such that <m>h = g q_1 + r_1</m>,
      with <m>r_1 = 0</m> or <m>\deg r_1 \lt \deg g</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore have

        <mrow>\amp = (a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)) g(x) + r_1(x)</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>q = a_m b_n^{-1} x^{m-n} + q_1(x)</m> and
      <m>r = r_1(x)</m> have the desired properties.

      <em>Uniqueness:</em> Suppose

      </me>,
      or <m>\hat{r} - r = g [q - \hat{q}]</m>.
      Thus either <m>\hat{r} - r = 0</m>,

        Let us reconsider <xref ref="ex_algebraicDefinitionC" />. We can now finish the argument. 
        We know that <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_i</m> is a principal ideal <m>(f(x))\subseteq \R[x]</m> and we know that <m>x^2+1\in f(x)</m>.
        That is, <m>x^2+1=g(x)f(x)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By degree constraints, <m>\deg(f(x)) = 0,1,2</m>. If <m>\deg(f(x)) = 0</m>, then <m>f(x)=c</m> a non-zero constant. Since <m>f(x)</m> 
        is in the kernel, we would have <m>\mathrm{ev}_i(f(x)) = 0</m> but this would say <m>c=0</m>, a contradiction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>\deg(f(x)) = 1</m>, then <m>f(x) = ax+b</m> and since it is in the kernel we would have <me>0 = \mathrm{ev}_i(f(x)) = f(i) = ai+b</me>.
        Thus <m>a=b=0</m> contradicting <m>\deg(f(x)) = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>\deg(f(x)) = 2</m> and therefore <m>\deg(g(x)) = 0</m> so that <m>g(x)=c</m>, a non-zero constant. That is to say, <m>f(x)</m> is a 
        scalar multiple of <m>x^2+1</m>. Since associates generate the same principal ideal, we have <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_i = (x^2+1)</m> as desired.

          Begin by assuming that <m>I</m> is prime,

        <p> Let <m>R</m> be commutative and let <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq R</m> be a non-zero proper
          ideal. We say that <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term> if no proper ideal
          of <m>R</m> properly contains <m>\mathfrak{m}</m>. That is, if <m>J</m> is an ideal satisfying <m>\mathfrak{m}\subseteq

    <p> 
      In other words, an ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}\ne R</m> is maximal if no <q>larger</q> ideal (with
      respect to inclusion) properly contains it. As we will see later, rings can have many maximal
      ideals. 
    </p>

    <p> It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal. This follows
      from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>; a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope
      of this text, but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of
      algebra for proving existence theorems. For example, a proof that every vector space has a
      basis relies on Zorn's Lemma. </p>
    <p> Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>, and are actively
      studied in modern research in commutative algebra (the study of commutative rings and their
      properties). </p>

    <p> The next two results demonstrate that the maximality of <m>I</m> is precisely the condition
      that guarantees that <m>R/I</m> is a field. </p>


    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p> Let <m>R</m> be commutative and <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> a maximal ideal of <m>R</m>. Let <m>x\in
          R\setminus \mathfrak{m}</m>, and set <m>J = \{xr+y\mid r\in R, \ y\in \mathfrak{m}\}</m>. Then: <m>J</m> is an
          ideal of <m>R</m> such that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq J</m>. Thus there exist <m>r'\in R</m>, <m>y'\in \mathfrak{m}</m>
          such that <m>1 = xr'+y'</m>. </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>J</m> be the set in question. Then <m>0\in\mathfrak{m}</m> as it is an ideal so <m>x\cdot 0 + 0 = 0\in J</m>.
          Take <m>xr_1+y_1,xr_2+y_2\in J</m>. Then:
          <me>(xr_1+y_1)+(xr_2+y_2) = x(r_1+r_2)+(y_1+y_2)</me>
          and since <m>y_1+y_2\in\mathfrak{m}</m> the sum is in <m>J</m>. So <m>J</m> is closed under addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For closure by multiplication by <m>R</m>: Take <m>r'\in R,\ xr+y\in J</m> then 
          <me>r'(xr+y) = x(rr') + r'y</me>
          and since <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> is an ideal we have <m>r'y\in\mathfrak{m}</m> so that <m>r'(xr+y)\in J</m>. We
          conclude that <m>J</m> is an ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last two statements, we know that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subseteq J</m>. Since <m>x = x\cdot 1 + 0\in J</m> 
          and <m>x\notin \mathfrak{m}</m> it cannot be that they are equal so that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq J\subseteq R</m>. By maximality, 
          it must be that <m>J = R</m>. Since <m>1\in R</m> there exists <m>r\in R</m> with <m>1 = xr + y</m> for some <m>y\in\mathfrak{m}</m>.

        <p> If <m>R/I</m> is a field, assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>

          and since <m>R/I</m> is a field, there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
          Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>. As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>, we have <m>1-xy\in

          I</m> is maximal. </p>
        <p> Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>. Apply the
          previous lemma to obtain <m>1 = xr + y'</m>, where <m>y\in I</m>. Then <me>
