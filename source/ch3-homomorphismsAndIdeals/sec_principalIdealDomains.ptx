  <introduction>
    <p>
      The examples at the end of the last section were interesting. In particular, when we looked at the 
      quotient of <m>\R[x]</m> by <m>(x^2+1)</m>. In this section, we aim to give more substance to the 
      Noether Isomorphism theorem in two ways: We isolate a class of domains where ideals are always principal and 
      we introduce two new types of ideals. We then use these ideas to study quotients of polynomials rings.

    <title>Principal Ideal Domains</title>
    
  <p>
    In <m>\Z</m>, and as we will see <m>F[x]</m> where <m>F</m> is a field, ideals are particularly simple in that they 
    are always principal. We first give domains satisfying that property a name.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <idx><h>Principal Ideal Domain</h></idx>
    <idx><h>PID</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An integral domain <m>R</m> in which every ideal is principal is known as a
        <term>principal ideal domain (PID)</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_ZisPID">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The ring <m>\Z</m> is a principal ideal domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The zero ideal is principally generated by <m>0</m> so we let <m>I\subseteq\Z</m> be a non-zero ideal and show it 
        is principally generated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider <m>S=I\cap \mathbb{N}</m>. Since <m>I\neq \{0\}</m>, there is <m>0\neq a\in I</m>. If <m>a\ge 0</m>, then <m>a\in S</m>. 
        Otherwise <m>-1\cdot a = -a\ge 0</m> so that <m>-a\in S</m> (ideals are closed under multiplication). Thus <m>S</m> is a non-empty subset 
        of <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and so it has a least element <m>d</m>. We claim <m>I = (d)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take any other element <m>b\in I</m>, which we assume is positive. Then the division algorithm tells us there exists <m>q,r\in\N</m> with 
        <m>0\leq r \lt d</m> such that <m>b = dq+r</m>. But this would tell us <m>r = b-dq\in I</m> and <m>r \lt d</m>. Since <m>d</m> is the least 
        positive element of <m>I</m>, this can only happen if <m>r=0</m> and so <m>b=dq</m> and <m>b\in (d)</m>. Therefore <m>I=(d)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>\Z</m> is a PID.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Notice that for any non-zero ideal of <m>\Z</m>, the greatest common divisor of all the elements is a principal generator (the negative of it is too). 
    We can use this to find the principal generator for ideals generated by more than one element:
  </p>
 

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a principal ideal domain and <m>x,y\in R</m> be not both zero.
        Let <m>I = \{xm+yn\mid m,n\in R\}</m>.
        Then:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>I</m> is an ideal, so there is some <m>d\in R</m> for which <m>I = (d)</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d</m> is a <xref ref="def_gcdDomain" text="custom">greatest common divisor</xref> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that there exist
        <m>s,t\in R</m> such that <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Observe that <m>0 = x0 + y0 \in I</m>.
      Additionally, if <m>x m_1 + y n_1, x m_2 + y n_2\in I</m>,
      then <m>(x m_1 + y n_1) + (x m_2 + y n_2) = x (m_1 + m_2) + y (n_1 + n_2) \in I</m>,
      and <m>r(x m_1 + y n_1) = x (rm_1) + y(rn_1) \in I</m>.
      Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>R</m> is a PID, there exists <m>d\in R</m> such that <m>I = (d)</m>.
      We claim that <m>d</m> is a GCD of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that <m>d|x</m>, as <m>x\cdot 1 + y\cdot 0\in I = (d)</m>.
      Similarly, <m>d|y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let <m>e\in R</m> be a common divisor of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      We wish to show that <m>e|d</m>.
      Write <m>x = e k_1</m> and <m>y = e k_2</m>.
      Since <m>d\in (d)</m>,
      there exist <m>s,t\in R</m> such that
      <m>d = x s + yt = (e k_1) s + (e k_2)t = e(k_1 s + k_2 t)</m>,
      and thus <m>e|d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, there exist
      <m>s,t\in R</m> such that a GCD <m>d</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be written as <m>d = xs + yt</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    We have so far abstracted and axiomatized several important algebraic properties of <m>\Z</m> that we discussed in <xref ref="sec_integers">&#xa7;</xref>.
    In particular, we have our usual operations of addition and multiplication,
    and their interactions, we have notions of divisibility/factorization, irreducibility, and primality;
    we also have cancellation and greatest common divisors.
  </p>

<!--
  <p>
    Our last major abstraction from <m>\Z</m> is the division algorithm.
    The main obstacle to postulating domains with a division algorithm is a clear notion of comparison relations.
    That is, if <m>R</m> is an arbitrary domain with <m>r,s\in R</m>,
    is it possible to clearly and sensibly say which of <m>r</m> or <m>s</m> is
    <q>bigger</q>
    ? (Recall that this was a requirement for the division algorithm with nonzero remainders.) However,
    if there is a way to relate elements of a domain <m>R</m> to <m>\N_0</m>,
    we can sensibly define a division algorithm.
  </p>
  
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be an integral domain.
        We call <m>R</m> a <term>Euclidean domain</term>
        if there is a function <m>\delta : R\setminus \set{0} \to \N_0</m> such that: <aside>This is the lowercase Greek letter
        <term>delta</term>.</aside>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>a,b\in R\setminus \set{0}</m>,
              then <m>\delta(a) \le \delta(ab)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>a,b\in R</m>, <m>b\ne 0</m>,
              then there exist <m>q,r\in R</m> such that <m>a = bq+r</m>,
              where either <m>r = 0</m> or <m>\delta(r) \lt \delta(b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We call the function <m>\delta</m> a
        <term>norm</term> for <m>R</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Thus, a Euclidean domain is an integral domain with a division algorithm that behaves in a familiar way. In the remainder of this section, we will investigate the properties of Euclidean domains.
    First, we consider some examples.

  <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The field <m>\Q</m> is a Euclidean domain under ordinary addition and multiplication, with <m>\delta(x) = 0</m> for all <m>x\in \Q</m>.

        Is <m>\Z</m> a Euclidean domain?
        If so, what is the norm function <m>\delta</m>,
        and why does this function have the required properties of a norm?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Yes.
        The norm is the absolute value function.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec_polynomialRingsOverAField">
    <title>Polynomial Rings over a Field</title>
    
    <p>
      Our next goal is to prove that polynomial rings over a field are always a PID. In the course of the proof we will notice that 
      such rings share a lot in common (factorization-wise) with integers. The key to factorization here is the degree function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start by proving any ideal (or any non-zero subset) of a polynomial ring has an element of least degree.
    </p>
  <lemma xml:id="lem_minimalDegreePoly">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>S\subseteq F[x]</m> a set containing a nonzero polynomial.
        Prove that <m>S</m> contains a polynomial <m>f</m> such that
        <m>\deg(f) \le \deg(g)</m> for all nonzero <m>g\in S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>T = \{\deg g\mid g\in S\}</m>.
      Since <m>S</m> contains a nonzero polynomial, <m>T\ne \emptyset</m>.
      By WOP, <m>T</m> contains a minimal element <m>d \ge 0</m>,
      which must be the degree of some polynomial in <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </lemma>
<p>
  Notice that in the proof of <xref ref="lem_minimalDegreePoly" /> we did not use that <m>F</m> was a field.
  In particular, we only need that there are non-zero polynomials, i.e. the coefficient ring is a non-zero ring.
</p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_polynomialsOverFieldArePID">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F</m> be a field. Then the ring <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>I</m> be a nonzero ideal of <m>F[x]</m> and let
      <m>f(x)\in I</m> be a non-zero polynomial of smallest degree.
      We claim <m>I = (f(x))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have <m>(f(x))\subseteq I</m> as <m>f(x)\in I</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>g(x)\in I</m> and use <xref ref="thm_polynomialDivisionAlgorithm" text="title" />
      to write <m>g(x) = f(x) q(x) + r(x)</m>,
      where <m>\deg r(x) \lt \deg f(x)</m>.
      As in <xref ref="thm_ZisPID">Theorem</xref>,
      write <m>r(x) = g(x) - f(x) q(x) \in I</m>. Since <m>\deg(r(x))\lt \deg(f(x))</m>, the only way this can happen is if 
      <m>r(x)=0</m>. Thus, <m>g(x) = f(x)q(x)</m> and so <m>f(x) | g(x)</m>. Hence, <m>g(x)\in (f(x))</m>. In particular, 
      <m>I\subseteq (f(x))</m> and we have <m>I=(f(x))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus any ideal in <m>F[x]</m> is principally generated and since <m>F[x]</m> is a domain, it is a principal ideal domain.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    The proof of <xref ref="thm_polynomialsOverFieldArePID"/> shows that to find a principal generated we need only look for a polynomial of minimal degree.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In this example, we will show how to give a purely algebraic construction of <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. What does it mean to algebraically construct <m>\sqrt{2}</m>?
        We will take this to mean having access to a number system with <m>\sqrt{2}</m> that does not involve analytic constructions. That is, we will avoid using <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. 
        Our starting algebraic system will be the rational numbers. If we had access to analysis, we could just allow the use of <m>\sqrt{2}</m> by throwing it into our set. We've 
        encountered this field already: <m>\Q[\sqrt{2}]</m>. Whatever we do should recover this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}\colon\mathbb{Q}[x]\to\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]</m> given by <m>\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}(p(x)) = p(\sqrt{2})</m>.
        We have seen many times that <m>\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}</m> is a homomorphism. Let us find it's kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\mathbb{Q}[x]</m> is a PID, the kernel is principally generated. Since <m>\mathrm{ev}_\sqrt{2}(x^2-2) = (\sqrt{2})^2-2=0</m>, the kernel is non-zero and so it is principally 
        generated by a non-zero polynomial. By the remark before this example, it is principally generated by a polynomial of least degree. Since <m>x^2-2\in\ker\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}</m>, it 
        is a candidate for the principal generator. We just need to see no elements of smaller degree are in the kernel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end, suppose <m>a+bx\in\ker\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}</m>. Then 
        <me>
          0 = \mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}(a+bx) = a+b\sqrt{2}
        </me>
        If <m>b\neq 0</m>, then <m>\sqrt{2}=-a/b</m> says <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational which is false. Thus <m>b=0</m> and so <m>a=0</m> too. We conclude that the kernel does not contain any terms 
        of degrees zero or one. Hence, <m>x^2-2</m> is a non-zero polynomial of smallest degree in the kernel. Thus <m>\ker\mathrm{ev}_{\sqrt{2}}=(x^2-2)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evaluation mapping is onto as for any <m>a+b\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]</m> we have 
        <me>
          \mathrm{ev}_\sqrt{2}(a+bx) = a+b\sqrt{2}.
        </me>
        Thus it is an epimorphism. By the Noether Isomorphism Theorem, we have an isomorphism:
        <me>
          \mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)\cong \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]
        </me>
        defined by <m>p(x)+(x^2-2)\mapsto p(\sqrt{2})</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring (field more precisely) <m>\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)</m> relies on:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Constructing the rational numbers <m>\Q</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Constructing the polynomial ring <m>\Q[x]</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Modding out that polynomial ring by the principal ideal <m>x^2-2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Each one of these steps is purely algebraic. The last step adds <m>\sqrt{2}</m> to <m>\Q</m> by saying we want to add a symbol <m>x</m> that squares to <m>2</m>.

            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
            Then <m>I</m> is prime if and only if <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain.

      </theorem>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Begin by assuming that <m>I</m> is prime,
          and suppose <m>(a+I)(b+I) = 0+I = I</m>.
          Then <m>ab \in I</m>, and since <m>I</m> is prime,

        </p>
        <p>
          Now assume that <m>R/I</m> is a domain.
          Further, let <m>a,b\in R</m> be such that <m>(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I = 0+I</m>.
          Then <m>ab\in I</m>, and since <m>R/I</m> is a domain,
          <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>,
          i.e., <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
          Thus, <m>I</m> is prime.

          <p>
            Alternatively, in <m>\Z[x]/(x^2)</m> we have <m>\bar{x}\neq 0</m> but <m>\bar{x}\cdot \bar{x} = \bar{x}^2=0</m>. Thus <m>\Z[x]/(x^2)</m> is not a domain and consequently <m>(x^2)</m> is not prime.

            The kernel of this mapping certainly contains <m>(x,2)</m> as polynomials in <m>(x,2)</m> are nothing more than the polynomials with even constant term, which reduces to 0 modulo 2.
            Any element not in <m>(x,2)</m> has odd constant term. Thus it will not be in the kernel. Hence, <m>\ker(\varphi) = (x,2)</m> and by the Noether Isomorphism Theorem <m>\Z[x]/(x,2)\cong\mathbb{F}_2</m>.
            This is a field and so a domain. Thus <m>(x,2)</m> is a prime ideal that is not principal.

      We now consider another important class of ideals: the maximal ideals.

      <statement>
        <p> Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and let <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq R</m> be a proper
          ideal. We say that <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term> if no proper ideal
          of <m>R</m> properly contains <m>\mathfrak{m}</m>. That is, if <m>J</m> is an ideal satisfying <m>\mathfrak{m}\subseteq
          J\subseteq R</m>, either <m>J=\mathfrak{m}</m> or <m>J=R</m>. </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p> 
      In other words, an ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}\ne R</m> is maximal if no <q>larger</q> ideal (with
      respect to inclusion) properly contains it. As we will see later, rings can have many maximal
      ideals. 
    </p>

    <p> It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal. This follows
      from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>; a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope
      of this text, but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of
      algebra for proving existence theorems. For example, a proof that every vector space has a
      basis relies on Zorn's Lemma. </p>
    <p> Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>, and are actively
      studied in modern research in commutative algebra (the study of commutative rings and their
      properties). </p>

    <p> The next two results demonstrate that the maximality of <m>I</m> is precisely the condition
      that guarantees that <m>R/I</m> is a field. </p>


    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p> Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> a maximal ideal of <m>R</m>. Let <m>x\in
          R\setminus \mathfrak{m}</m>, and set <m>J = \{xr+y\mid r\in R, \ y\in \mathfrak{m}\}</m>. Then: <m>J</m> is an
          ideal of <m>R</m> such that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq J</m>. Thus there exist <m>r'\in R</m>, <m>y'\in \mathfrak{m}</m>
          such that <m>1 = xr'+y'</m>. </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>J</m> be the set in question. Then <m>0\in\mathfrak{m}</m> as it is an ideal so <m>x\cdot 0 + 0 = 0\in J</m>.
          Take <m>xr_1+y_1,xr_2+y_2\in J</m>. Then:
          <me>(xr_1+y_1)+(xr_2+y_2) = x(r_1+r_2)+(y_1+y_2)</me>
          and since <m>y_1+y_2\in\mathfrak{m}</m> the sum is in <m>J</m>. So <m>J</m> is closed under addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For closure by multiplication by <m>R</m>: Take <m>r'\in R,\ xr+y\in J</m> then 
          <me>r'(xr+y) = x(rr') + r'y</me>
          and since <m>\mathfrak{m}</m> is an ideal we have <m>r'y\in\mathfrak{m}</m> so that <m>r'(xr+y)\in J</m>. We
          conclude that <m>J</m> is an ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last two statements, we know that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subseteq J</m>. Since <m>x = x\cdot 1 + 0\in J</m> 
          and <m>x\notin \mathfrak{m}</m> it cannot be that they are equal so that <m>\mathfrak{m}\subsetneq J\subseteq R</m>. By maximality, 
          it must be that <m>J = R</m>. Since <m>1\in R</m> there exists <m>r\in R</m> with <m>1 = xr + y</m> for some <m>y\in\mathfrak{m}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p> Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>. Then <m>I</m> is maximal

      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p> For the forward direction, apply the previous lemma to construct an inverse for <m>x+I</m>
          given any <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>. </p>
      </hint>
      <proof>
        <p> If <m>R/I</m> is a field, assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>
          I</m>. Let <m>x\in J\setminus I</m>; then <m>x+I</m> is a nonzero element of <m>R/I</m>,
          and since <m>R/I</m> is a field, there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
          Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>. As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>, we have <m>1-xy\in
          I\subsetneq J</m>, and thus <m>1 = (1-xy)+xy \in J</m>, which means <m>J = R</m>. Thus, <m>
          I</m> is maximal. </p>
        <p> Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>. Apply the
          previous lemma to obtain <m>1 = xr + y'</m>, where <m>y\in I</m>. Then <me>
            1 + I = xr+y + I = xr + I = (x+I)(r+I).

        <p>
          Every maximal ideal is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p> All fields are integral domains. Thus, if <m>I</m> is maximal, <m>R/I</m> is a field,
          thus a domain, and thus <m>I</m> is prime. </p>

        <p> Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>\mathfrak{p}=(p)</m> a prime ideal. By previous work, <m>p</m>

          so <m>m|p</m>. That is, <m>p = mk</m>. Since <m>p</m> is prime and <m>R</m> is a domain,
          it is irreducible. Thus, either <m>m</m> or <m>k</m> is a unit. If <m>m</m> is a unit,
          then <m>(m) = R</m>. If <m>k</m> is a unit, then <m>m = k^{-1} p</m>, and thus <m>m\in (p)</m>,
