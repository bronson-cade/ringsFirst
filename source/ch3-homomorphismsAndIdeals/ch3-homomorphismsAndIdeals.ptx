  <title>Homomorphisms and Ideals</title>

  <introduction>
		<p>
			In this chapter, we revisit <xref ref="ch1-integers"/>. That is, we set out to generalize how we constructed <m>\Z/m</m> from <m>\Z</m>. We begin in <xref ref="sec_homomorphisms"/>
			by describing how rings interact with other rings. This is a critical foundational step as the arithmetic in <m>\Z/m</m> came from that in <m>\Z</m>. In 
			<xref ref="sec_ideals"/> we abstract congruence modulo <m>m</m> to general rings. In <xref ref="sec_quotientRings"/> we describe the quotient process and 
			the Noether Isomorphism Theorem, a fundamental tool for identifying quotient rings. In <xref ref="sec_principalIdealDomains"/> we isolate a class of domains that 
			behave similarly, in some ways, to <m>\Z</m>.
