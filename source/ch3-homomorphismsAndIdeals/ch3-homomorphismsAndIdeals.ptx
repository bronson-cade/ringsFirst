  <title>Homomorphisms and Ideals</title>

  <introduction>
  	<p>
  		The first three chapters of this text tell the story of unique factorization.
  		The culmination is the result that any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain; that is, in an integral domain with a well-behaved division algorithm, a nonzero nonunit necessarily factors uniquely into irreducibles.
  		In order to expediently develop that result, we ignored many concepts that are otherwise interesting and useful in a first course in abstract algebra.
  		This chapter is a coda that seeks to fill in some of those gaps.
  	</p>
  		<p>In <xref ref="SubSec-Ideals-In-General" />, we expand on the <xref ref="def-ideal" text="custom">definition of ideal</xref> introduced in <xref ref="SubSec-Principal-Ideals" /> and explore non-principal ideals.
  		No math course is complete without a discussion of functions of some sort; we explore homomorphisms in <xref ref="SubSec-Homomorphisms" />
  		Finally, in <xref ref="SubSec-Quotient-Rings" />, we introduce prime and maximal ideals, as well as the notion of congruence modulo <m>I</m> and use ideals to build new rings from old. We conclude with an exploration and proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem.
