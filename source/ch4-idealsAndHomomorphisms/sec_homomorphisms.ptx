      In this section, we'll seek to answer the questions:
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>What is a ring homomorphism?</li>
      <li>What are some examples of ring homomorphisms?</li>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Central to modern mathematics is the notion of <em>function</em><fn>This section assumes a familiarity with the idea of function from a set-theoretic point of view, as well as the concepts of injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective functions (one-to-one correspondences).</fn>.
      Functions arise in all areas of mathematics, each subdiscipline concerned with certain types of functions.
      In algebra, our concern is with <em>operation-preserving</em> functions, such as the linear transformations <m>L : V\to W</m> of vector spaces you have seen in a course in linear algebra.
      Those linear transformations had the properties that <m>L(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}) = L(\mathbf{v})+L(\mathbf{u})</m> (addition is preserved) and <m>L(c\mathbf{u}) = c L(\mathbf{u})</m> (scalar multiplication is preserved).
    </p>
    <p>
    We find something similar at work in the study of homomorphisms of rings, which we define to be functions that preserve both addition and multiplication.
    </p>

        Let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be rings. A function <m>\varphi : R\to S</m> is called a
        <term>ring homomorphism</term>
        if it preserves addition, multiplication, and sends the identity of <m>R</m> to the identity of <m>S</m>.
        That is, for all <m>x,y\in R</m>:
        <ul>
          <li><m>\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x) + \varphi(y)</m>,</li>
          <li><m>\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)</m>, and</li>
          <li><m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_S</m>.</li>
        </ul>
        If <m>\varphi</m> is injective (one-to-one), we say that <m>\varphi</m> is a <term>monomorphism</term>. If <m>\varphi</m> is surjective (onto), 
        we say that <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>epimorphism</term>. If <m>\varphi</m> is a bijection (both injective and surjective), we say that <m>\p</m> is an <term>isomorphism</term>
        and write <m>R\cong S</m>.
        If <m>\varphi : R\to R</m> is an isomorphism, we say <m>\varphi</m> is an <term>automorphism</term> of <m>R</m>.

    <solution>
      <ol>
        <li><m>\varphi\colon R\to R</m> defined by <m>\varphi(x)=x</m> is called the <term>identity mapping</term>. We in particular have: 
          <m>\varphi(1_R) = 1_R</m>, <m>\varphi(x+y) = x+y = \varphi(x)+\varphi(y)</m>, and <m>\varphi(xy)=xy=\varphi(x)\varphi(y).</m>
          The identity mapping satisfies the criteria for being a ring homomorphism. It is an automorphism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>\psi\colon R\to R</m> defined by <m>\psi(x)=-x</m> is the negation mapping. Although it is true that
          <me>\psi(x+y) = -(x+y) = -x+(-y)=\psi(x)+\psi(y)</me>
          it fails the other two properties of a ring homorphism in general (sometimes not though!). Namely, for a general ring <m>1_R\neq -1_R</m> so that <m>\psi(1_R) = -1_R\neq 1_R</m> and also <m>\psi(xy) = -xy</m> but <m>\psi(x)\psi(y) = (-x)(-y) = xy</m>. In general, <m>xy\neq -xy</m> so <m>\psi</m> is not compatible with multiplication or unity. However, sometimes <m>-a = a</m> is true for every element of the ring, particularly Boolean rings. Examples include <m>\Z/2, \Z/2[x]</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>\alpha\colon \Z\to \Z</m> defined by <m>\alpha(x)=5x</m>, or the multiplication by <m>5</m> map. The map <m>\alpha</m> does not preserve the unity nor does it preserve multiplication. Check! It is not a ring homomorphism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>Fr\colon \Z_2[x]\to \Z_2[x]</m> defined by <m>Fr(p) = p^2</m> is sometimes called the Frobenius mapping. It is in fact a ring homomorphism in this case. For the unity and multiplicative compatibility we have 
          <m>Fr(1) = 1^2 = 1</m> and <m>Fr(pq) = (pq)^2 = p^2q^2=Fr(p)Fr(q)</m>. For compatibility with addition we remind the reader that <m>2\equiv_20</m>:
          <me>Fr(p+q) = (p+q)^2 = p^2+2pq+q^2 = p^2+q^2 = Fr(p)+Fr(q).</me>
          It is not an automorphism; however, it is a homomorphism. Homomorphisms from a ring to itself are called <term>endomorphisms</term>.

      Homomorphisms give rise to a particularly important class of subsets: kernels.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\p : R \to S</m> be a ring homomorphism.
        Then <m>\ker \p =\setof{r\in R}{\p(r)=0_S}</m> is the
        <term>kernel</term> of <m>\p</m>.

  In fact, kernels are not just important subsets of rings; they are ideals.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a ring homomorphism <m>\p : R\to S</m>,
        <m>\ker\p</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>x,y\in \ker\p</m>, <m>\p(x+y) = \p(x) + \p(y) = 0_S + 0_S = 0_S</m>.
      Similarly, if <m>x\in \ker \p</m> and <m>r\in R</m>,
      <m>\p(rx) = \p(r) \p(x) = \p(r) 0_S = 0_S</m>.

      Kernels also give a useful way of determining whether their defining homomorphisms are one-to-one.
