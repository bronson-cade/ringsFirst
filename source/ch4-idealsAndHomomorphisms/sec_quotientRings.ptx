    <p>
    		If the only rings that existed were polynomial rings, familiar systems of numbers like <m>\Z, \Q, \R, \C</m>, and matrix rings, there would still be enough to justify defining the concept of a ring and exploring its properties. 
    		However, these are not the only rings that exist.
    		In this section, we explore a way of building new rings from old by means of ideals.
    		To better understand these new rings, we will also define two new classes of ideals: prime ideals, and maximal ideals.
    		We end by briefly connecting these rings to a familiar problem from high school algebra.

	<title>Congruence modulo <m>I</m></title>
	
	<p>
		The major concept of this section is the notion of congruence modulo <m>I</m>.
		One can reasonably think of this idea as a generalization of congruence modulo <m>m</m> in <m>\Z</m>.

          Let <m>R</m> be a ring, <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>, and <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          We say <m>a</m> is
          <term>congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>I</m></term> if <m>b-a\in I</m>.
          If this is the case, we write <m>a + I = b + I</m>.

    <exploration>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a ring <m>R</m>, ideal <m>I</m>,
          and <m>a\in R</m>, when is it the case that <m>a + I = 0 + I = I</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          When <m>a\in I</m>.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      Observe that if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
      then there is some <m>x\in I</m> such that <m>b-a = x</m>,
      and so <m>b = a+x</m>.

    </p>
    
    <p>
    	As was the case in <m>\Z_m</m>, congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation.
    	</p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,
        so <m>a + I = a+I</m> and the relation is reflexive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,
        then <m>-1(b-a) = a-b \in I</m>,
        so the relation is symmetric.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>b-a \in I</m> and <m>c-b\in I</m>,
        then <m>(b-a) + (c-b) = c-a \in I</m>,
        so the relation is transitive.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>.
      What is more, this is not merely a set of equivalence classes.
      As the next two theorems demonstrate, this set possesses two algebraic operations that extend naturally from those of <m>R</m>.
    </p>
    

    
    <theorem xml:id="thm-addition-mod-I">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          If <m>a,b,c,d\in R</m> such that
          <m>a+I = b+I</m> and <m>c+I = d+I</m>,
          then <m>(a+c) + I = (b+d) + I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>a+I = b+I</m> and <m>c+I = d+I</m>.
        Then <m>b-a =x \in I</m> and <m>d-c = y \in I</m>.
        Adding, we have <m>(b-a) + (d-c) = (b+d) - (a+c) = x+y \in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>(b+d) + I = (a+c) + I</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm-multiplication-mod-I">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          If <m>a,b,c,d\in R</m> such that
          <m>a+I = b+I</m> and <m>c+I = d+I</m>,
          then <m>ac + I = bd + I</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        As before, we observe that
        <m>b-a = x\in I</m> and <m>d-c = y\in I</m>.
        Write <m>b = x+a</m> and <m>d = c+y</m>.
        Then <m>bd = (x+a)(c+y) = xc + xy + ac + ay = ac + \underbrace{(xc+xy+ay)}_{\in I}</m>,
        so <m>bd - ac \in I</m>, and thus <m>bd + I = ac + I</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
      The previous two theorems together show that addition and multiplication on the set <m>R/I</m> is well-defined.
      As these operations are built on the operations of <m>R</m>, it will likely not surprise you to learn that the usual <xref ref="def_ring" text="custom">axioms defining a ring</xref> also hold.
    </p>
    <theorem>
    <idx>quotient ring</idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity <m>1_R</m>, <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>, and <m>a,b\in R</m>.
          The set of equivalence classes modulo <m>I</m>, denoted <m>R/I</m>,
          is a commutative ring (called the <term>quotient ring</term> of <m>R</m> by <m>I</m>) with identity <m>1_R + I</m> under the following operations:
          <!-- the operations of addition modulo <m>I</m> and multiplication modulo <m>I</m> defined in <xref ref="thm-addition-mod-I" /> and <xref ref="thm-multiplication-mod-I" />. -->

        <md>
          <mrow>(a+I) + (b+I) &amp; := (a+b) + I</mrow>
          <mrow>(a+I) \cdot (b+I) &amp; := (ab) + I.</mrow>
        </md>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      	These operations were shown to be well-defined in <xref ref="thm-addition-mod-I" /> and <xref ref="thm-multiplication-mod-I" />.
      </proof>

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    Thus, given a ring <m>R</m> and ideal <m>I</m> of <m>R</m>, we may build the quotient ring <m>R/I</m>.

    In <xref ref="subsec-prime-maximal-ideal" />, we will explore the question of when <m>R/I</m> possesses some of the properties we've previously explored, e.g., when is <m>R/I</m> a domain? A field?
    First, we conclude with two explorations. The first gives us a sense of what these rings can look like. The second connects quotient rings to <em>solution sets</em> of polynomial equations.

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I</m> is prime if and only if <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Begin by assuming that <m>I</m> is prime,
        and suppose <m>(a+I)(b+I) = 0+I = I</m>.
        Then <m>ab \in I</m>, and since <m>I</m> is prime,
        either <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus either <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>R/I</m> is a domain.
        Further, let <m>a,b\in R</m> be such that <m>(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I = 0+I</m>.
        Then <m>ab\in I</m>, and since <m>R/I</m> is a domain,
        <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>,
        i.e., <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is prime.

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and let <m>M\subsetneq R</m> be a nonzero ideal.
          We say that <m>M</m> is a <term>maximal ideal</term>
          if no proper ideal of <m>R</m> properly contains <m>M</m>.
          That is, if <m>J</m> is an ideal satisfying <m>M\subseteq J\subseteq R</m>,
          either <m>J=M</m> or <m>J=R</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    	In other words, an ideal <m>M\ne R</m> is maximal if no <q>larger</q> ideal (with respect to inclusion) properly contains it.
    	As we will see later, rings can have many maximal ideals.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal.
      This follows from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>;
      a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope of this text,
      but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of algebra for proving existence theorems.
      For example,
      a proof that every vector space has a basis relies on Zorn's Lemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>,
      and are actively studied in modern research in commutative algebra
      (the study of commutative rings and their properties).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	The next two results demonstrate that the maximality of <m>I</m> is precisely the condition that guarantees that <m>R/I</m> is a field.

    <lemma>

        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>M</m> a maximal ideal of <m>R</m>.

          and set <m>J = \setof{xr+y}{r\in R, \ y\in M}</m>.
          Then: <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m>; <m>M\subsetneq J</m>;
          and thus there exist <m>r'\in R</m>,
          <m>y'\in M</m> such that <m>1 = xr'+y'</m>.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I</m> is maximal if and only if <m>R/I</m> is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          For the forward direction, apply the previous lemma to construct an inverse for <m>x+I</m> given any <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>I</m>.
        Let <m>x\in J\setminus I</m>;
        then <m>x+I</m> is a nonzero element of <m>R/I</m>,
        and since <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
        Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>.
        As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>,
        we have <m>1-xy\in I\subsetneq J</m>,
        and thus <m>1 = (1-xy)+xy \in J</m>, which means <m>J = R</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        Apply the previous lemma to obtain
        <m>1 = xr' + y'</m>, where <m>y'\in I</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          1 + I = xs+y + I = xs + I = (x+I)(y+I).

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every maximal ideal is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        All fields are integral domains.
        Thus, if <m>I</m> is maximal,
        <m>R/I</m> is a field, thus a domain,
        and thus <m>I</m> is prime.

    		In general, the converse is not true (see the <xref ref="challenge-nonmaximal-prime" text="custom">Challenge</xref> below).
    		However, it holds in sufficiently nice rings.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-pid-primes-are-maximal">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In a principal ideal domain, every prime ideal is maximal.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>\ideal{p}</m> a prime ideal.
        By previous work, <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>\ideal{p} \subseteq \ideal{m}</m>.
        Thus, <m>p\in \ideal{m}</m>, so <m>m|p</m>.
        That is, <m>p = mk</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is prime and <m>R</m> is a domain, it is irreducible.
        Thus, either <m>m</m> or <m>k</m> is a unit.
        If <m>m</m> is a unit, then <m>\ideal{m} = R</m>.
        If <m>k</m> is a unit, then <m>m = k^{-1} p</m>,
        and thus <m>m\in \ideal{p}</m>,
        which means that <m>\ideal{m} = \ideal{p}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\ideal{p}</m> is maximal.

    	<title>Homomorphisms and Quotient Rings</title>
    	
    	<p>
    		As quotient rings provide fertile soil for building new examples of rings, it should not surprise us to find that homomorphisms interact with quotient rings in interesting and useful ways.
    		Chief among them are the <em>isomorphism theorems</em>.
    		In this subsection, we focus primarily on the First Isomorphism Theorem.
    		
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		We have seen that any homomorphism <m>\p : R\to S</m> gives rise to an ideal of <m>R</m>, namely <m>\ker\p</m>.
    		Our next theorem demonstrates that, given a commutative ring with identity <m>R</m>, every ideal is the kernel of some homomorphism defined on <m>R</m>.

    	<theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Define <m>\p: R\to R/I</m> by <m>\p(r) = r+I</m>.
          Then <m>\p</m> is a homomorphism with <m>\ker\p = I</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    
    <p>
      In what follows,
      we work toward a proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings with identity,
      and let <m>\p : R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
      Recall that <m>\im \p = \setof{s\in S}{\p(r) = s\text{ for some } r\in R}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>f: R/\ker \p \to \im \p</m> by <m>f(r+\ker \p) = \p(r)</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation from above,
          <m>f</m> is a well-defined function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker\p</m>.
        Then <m>r_2-r_1 \in \ker\p</m>,
        so <m>\p(r_2-r_1) = 0_S</m>, and thus <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Therefore, <m>f(r_1+\ker\p) = f(r_2+\ker\p)</m>,
        and <m>f</m> is well-defined.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>

        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly.
        Observe that <m>f((x+\ker\p) + (y+\ker\p)) = f((x+y)+\ker\p) = \p(x+y) = \p(x)+\p(y) = f(x+\ker\p) + f(y+\ker\p)</m>.

    <lemma>
      <statement>

          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f(r_1 + \ker\p) = f(r_2 + \ker\p)</m>.
        That is, <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Then <m>\p(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\p</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker \p</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is onto.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\p</m> is onto <m>\im \p</m> by definition,
        given any <m>s\in \im \p</m> there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>\p(r) = s</m>.
        Then <m>f(r+\ker\p) = \p(r)</m>.

        Define <m>\p: \R[x] \to \C</m> by <m>\p(p(x)) = p(i)</m>.
        We saw earlier that this evaluation map is a homomorphism.

        <m>\p(a+bx) = a+bi</m> for any <m>a,b\in \R</m>.
